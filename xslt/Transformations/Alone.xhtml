      <h1>Alone</h1>
      <h2>March 17, 1829</h2>
      <p>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> childhood's hour I have not been
<br/>As others were—I have not seen
<br/>As others saw—I could not bring
<br/>My passions <span class="prep open">from</span> a common spring—
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> the same source I have not taken
<br/>My <span class="noun closed">sorrow</span>—I could not <span class="verb open">awaken</span>
         <br/>My heart to joy at the same tone—
<br/>And all I loved—I loved alone—
<br/>Thou—<span class="prep closed">in</span> my childhood—<span class="prep closed">in</span> the <span class="noun open">dawn</span>
         <br/>Of a most stormy life—was drawn
<br/>From every <span class="noun closed">depth</span> of good and ill
<br/>The mystery which <span class="verb closed">binds</span> me still—
<br/>From the <span class="noun open">torrent</span>, or the <span class="noun open">fountain</span>—
<br/>From the red <span class="noun open">cliff</span> of the <span class="noun open">mountain</span>—
<br/>From the <span class="noun open">sun</span> that <span class="adv closed">round</span> me roll'd
<br/>In its autumn tint of gold—
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> the lightning <span class="prep closed">in</span> the <span class="noun open">sky</span>
         <br/>As it passed me <span class="verb open">flying</span> by—
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> the <span class="noun open">thunder</span> and the <span class="noun open">storm</span>—
<br/>And the <span class="noun open">cloud</span> that took the form
<br/>(When the rest of <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> was blue)
<br/>Of a demon <span class="prep closed">in</span> my view.
