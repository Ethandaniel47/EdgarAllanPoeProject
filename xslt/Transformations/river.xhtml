      <h1>TO THE RIVER</h1>
      <p>
    Fair river! in thy bright, <span class="adj open">clear</span> flow
    <br/>Of <span class="adj open">crystal</span>, wandering water,
    <br/>Thou art an emblem of the glow
    <br/>Of beauty—the <span class="adj open">unhidden</span> heart,
    <br/>The playful <span class="noun closed">maziness</span> of art
    <br/>In old Alberto's daughter;
  </p>
      <p>
    But when within thy wave she looks,
    <br/>Which glistens then, and <span class="verb closed">trembles</span>,
    <br/>Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
    <br/>Her worshipper resembles;
    <br/>For in his heart, as in thy stream,
    <br/>Her image <span class="adv closed">deeply</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">lies</span>—
    <br/>His heart which <span class="verb closed">trembles</span> at the beam
    <br/>Of her <span class="verb open">soul-searching</span> eyes.
  </p>
