      <h2>1844</h2>
      <p>
By a route obscure and lonely,
<br/>Haunted by ill <span class="noun open">angels</span> only,
<br/>Where an Eidolon, named <span class="noun closed">Night</span>,
<br/>On a black throne reigns upright,
<br/>I have reached these lands but newly
<br/>From an ultimate dim Thule—
<br/>From a wild weird clime that <span class="verb closed">lieth</span>, sublime,
<br/>Out of Space—out of Time.
</p>
      <p>
Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
<br/>And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
<br/>With forms that no man can discover
<br/>For the dews that drip all over;
<br/>Mountains toppling evermore
<br/>Into seas without a shore;
<br/>Seas that restlessly aspire,
<br/>Surging, unto skies of fire;
<br/>Lakes that endlessly outspread
<br/>Their lone waters—lone and dead,
<br/>Their still waters—still and chilly
<br/>With the snows of the lolling lily.
</p>
      <p>
By the lakes that thus outspread
<br/>Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
<br/>Their sad waters, sad and chilly
<br/>With the snows of the lolling lily,—
</p>
      <p>
By the mountains—near the river
<br/>Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—
<br/>By the gray woods,—by the swamp
<br/>Where the toad and the newt encamp,—
<br/>By the dismal tarns and pools 
<br/>Where dwell the Ghouls,—
<br/>By each spot the most unholy—
<br/>In each nook most melancholy,—
</p>
      <p>
There the traveller meets aghast
<br/>Sheeted Memories of the past—
<br/>Shrouded forms that start and sigh
<br/>As they pass the wanderer by—
<br/>White-robed forms of friends long given,
<br/>In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.
</p>
      <p>
For the heart whose woes are legion
<br/>'Tis a peaceful, soothing region—
<br/>For the spirit that walks in shadow
<br/>'Tis—oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
<br/>But the traveller, travelling through it,
<br/>May not—dare not openly view it;
<br/>Never its mysteries are exposed
<br/>To the weak human eye unclosed;
<br/>So wills its King, who hath forbid
<br/>The uplifting of the fringed lid;
<br/>And thus the sad Soul that here passes
<br/>Beholds it but through darkened glasses.
</p>
      <p>
By a route obscure and lonely,
<br/>Haunted by ill angels only. 
<br/>Where an Eidolon, named Night,
<br/>On a black throne reigns upright,
<br/>I have wandered home but newly
<br/>From this ultimate dim Thule.
