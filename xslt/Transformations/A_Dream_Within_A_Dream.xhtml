      <h1>A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM</h1>
      <h2>1849</h2>
      <p>
            Take this kiss <span class="prep open">upon</span> the brow!
            <br/>And, <span class="prep closed">in</span> 
         <span class="verb open">parting</span> from you now,
            <br/>Thus much let me avow--
            <br/>You are not wrong, who deem
            <br/>That my days have been a dream:
            <br/>Yet if hope has <span class="verb open">flown</span> 
         <span class="prep open">away</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a night, or <span class="prep closed">in</span> a day,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a vision or <span class="prep closed">in</span> none,
            <br/>Is it therefore the less gone?
            <br/>All that we see or seem
            <br/>Is but a dream <span class="prep closed">within</span> a dream.
        </p>
      <p>
            I stand amid the roar
            <br/>Of a surf-tormented shore,
            <br/>And I hold <span class="prep closed">within</span> my hand
            <br/>Grains of the golden sand--
            <br/>How few! yet how they creep
            <br/>Through my fingers to the <span class="noun closed">deep</span>
            <br/>While I weep--while I weep!
            <br/>O <span class="noun open">God</span>! can I not <span class="verb closed">grasp</span>
            <br/>Them with a <span class="adj closed">tighter</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">clasp</span>?
            <br/>O <span class="noun open">God</span>! can I not save
            <br/>One from the pitiless wave?
            <br/>Is all that we see or seem
            <br/>But a dream <span class="prep open">within</span> a dream?
        </p>
