      <h1>Hymn (translation from the Greek
        Hymn to Aristogeiton and Harmodius</h1>
      <h2>1827</h2>
      <p>
        Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll <span class="verb closed">conceal</span>,
        <br/>Like those champions devoted and brave,
        <br/>When they <span class="verb closed">plunged</span> in the <span class="noun closed">tyrant</span> their steel,
        <br/>And to Athens deliverance gave.
    </p>
      <p>
        Beloved heroes! your <span class="adj open">deathless</span> souls roam
        <br/>In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
        <br/>Where the mighty of old have their homeâ€”
        <br/>Where <span class="foreign ">Achilles</span> and <span class="foreign ">Diomed</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">rest</span>.
    </p>
      <p>
        In fresh myrtle my blade I'll <span class="verb closed">entwine</span>,
        <br/>Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,
        <br/>When he made at the <span class="foreign ">tutelar</span> shrine
        <br/>A <span class="foreign ">libation</span> of Tyranny's <span class="noun closed">blood</span>.
    </p>
      <p>
        Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!
        <br/>Ye avengers of Liberty's <span class="noun closed">wrongs</span>!
        <br/>Endless ages shall cherish your fame,
        <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Embalmed</span> in their echoing songs!
    </p>
