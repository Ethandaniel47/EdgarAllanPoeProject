      <p>At midnight, in the month of June,
<br/>I stand <span class="prep closed">beneath</span> the mystic moon.
<br/>An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
<br/>
         <span class="verb open">Exhales</span> from <span class="adv open">out</span> her golden rim,
<br/>And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
<br/>
         <span class="prep closed">Upon</span> the quiet mountain top,
<br/>Steals drowsily and musically
<br/>
         <span class="prep closed">Into</span> the universal valley.
<br/>The rosemary nods upon the <span class="noun closed">grave</span>;
<br/>The lily lolls upon the wave;
<br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Wrapping</span> the fog about its breast,
<br/>The ruin moulders into rest;
<br/>Looking like <span class="ref myth">Lethe</span>, see! the lake
<br/>A conscious <span class="verb closed">slumber</span> seems to take,
<br/>And would not, for the world, <span class="verb open">awake</span>.
<br/>All Beauty <span class="verb closed">sleeps</span>!—and lo! where <span class="verb closed">lies</span>
         <br/>(Her <span class="noun open">casement</span> 
         <span class="adj open">open</span> to the <span class="noun open">skies</span>)
<br/>
         <span class="ref myth">Irene</span>, with her <span class="ref myth">Destinies</span>! </p>
      <p>Oh, lady bright! can it be right—
<br/>This <span class="noun open">window</span> 
         <span class="adj open">open</span> to the night!
<br/>The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
<br/>Laughingly <span class="prep open">through</span> the lattice-drop—
<br/>The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
<br/>Flit <span class="prep open">through</span> thy <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> and <span class="prep open">out</span>,
<br/>And wave the curtain canopy
<br/>So fitfully—so fearfully—
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">Above</span> the <span class="adj closed">closed</span> and fringed <span class="noun closed">lid</span>
         <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">'Neath</span> which thy <span class="verb closed">slumb'ring</span> soul <span class="verb closed">lies</span> 
         <span class="adj closed">hid</span>,
<br/>That, <span class="adv open">o'er</span> the floor and <span class="adv closed">down</span> the wall,
<br/>Like ghosts the shadows <span class="verb open">rise</span> and <span class="verb closed">fall</span>!
<br/>Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
<br/>Why and what art thou <span class="verb open">dreaming</span> here?
<br/>Sure thou art come <span class="adv open">o'er</span> far-off <span class="noun open">seas</span>,
<br/>A wonder to these <span class="noun closed">garden</span> trees!
<br/>Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
<br/>Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
<br/>And this all-solemn silentness!</p>
      <p>The lady <span class="verb closed">sleeps</span>! Oh, may her <span class="noun closed">sleep</span>
         <br/>Which is enduring, so be <span class="adj closed">deep</span>!
<br/>
         <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> have her in its sacred <span class="noun closed">keep</span>!
<br/>This <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> changed for one more holy,
<br/>This <span class="noun closed">bed</span> for one more melancholy,
<br/>I pray to God that she may <span class="verb closed">lie</span>
         <br/>For ever with <span class="adj closed">unopened</span> eye,
<br/>While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!</p>
      <p>My love, she <span class="verb closed">sleeps</span>! Oh, may her <span class="noun closed">sleep</span>,
<br/>As it is lasting, so be <span class="adj closed">deep</span>;
<br/>Soft may the worms about her creep!
<br/>Far in the forest, dim and old,
<br/>For her may some tall <span class="noun closed">vault</span> 
         <span class="verb open">unfold</span>—
<br/>Some <span class="noun closed">vault</span> that oft hath flung its black
<br/>And <span class="adj open">winged</span> panels <span class="adj open">fluttering</span> back,
<br/>Triumphant, <span class="prep open">o'er</span> the crested <span class="noun closed">palls</span>,
<br/>Of her grand family funerals—
<br/>Some <span class="noun closed">sepulchre</span>, remote, alone, 
<br/>Against whose <span class="noun open">portal</span> she hath thrown,
<br/>In childhood many an idle stone—
<br/>Some <span class="noun closed">tomb</span> from <span class="adv open">out</span> whose sounding <span class="noun open">door</span>
         <br/>She ne'er shall force an echo more,
<br/>Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
<br/>It was the dead who groaned <span class="prep closed">within</span>.</p>
