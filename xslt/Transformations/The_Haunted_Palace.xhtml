         <span class="prep open">In</span> the greenest of our <span class="noun closed">valleys</span>
         <br/>By good <span class="noun open">angels</span> tenanted,
<br/>Once a fair and stately palace—
<br/>Radiant palace—reared its head.
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">in</span> the monarch Thought's dominion—
<br/>It stood there!
<br/>Never seraph spread a pinion 
<br/>Over fabric half so fair!</p>
      <p>Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
<br/>
         <span class="prep closed">On</span> its <span class="noun closed">roof</span> did <span class="verb open">float</span> and <span class="verb open">flow</span>,
<br/>(This—all this—was <span class="prep closed">in</span> the olden 
<br/>Time long ago),
<br/>And every gentle air that dallied,
<br/>
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> that sweet day,
<br/>Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, 
<br/>A <span class="adj open">winged</span> odor went away. </p>
      <p>Wanderers <span class="prep closed">in</span> that happy <span class="noun closed">valley</span>,
<br/>Through two luminous <span class="noun open">windows</span>, saw
<br/>Spirits moving musically, 
<br/>To a lute's well-tunëd law,
<br/>
         <span class="verb open">Bound</span> about a throne where, sitting
<br/>(Porphyrogene!)
<br/>
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> state his glory well befitting,
<br/>The ruler of the realm was seen. </p>
      <p>And all with pearl and ruby glowing 
<br/>Was the fair palace <span class="noun open">door</span>,
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">Through</span> which came <span class="verb open">flowing</span>, <span class="verb open">flowing</span>, <span class="verb open">flowing</span>,
<br/>And sparkling evermore,
<br/>A troop of <span class="ref myth">Echoes</span>, whose sweet duty
<br/>Was but to sing,
<br/>
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> voices of surpassing beauty,
<br/>The wit and wisdom of their king. </p>
      <p>But evil things, <span class="prep closed">in</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">robes</span> of sorrow,
<br/>Assailed the monarch's high estate.
<br/>(Ah, let us mourn!—for never morrow 
<br/>Shall dawn <span class="prep closed">upon</span> him desolate !)
<br/>And round about his home the glory
<br/>That blushed and <span class="verb open">bloomed</span>,
<br/>Is but a dim-remembered story 
<br/>Of the old time <span class="verb closed">entombed</span>.</p>
      <p>
And travellers, now, <span class="prep closed">within</span> that valley,
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">Through</span> the red-litten <span class="noun open">windows</span> see
<br/>
         <span class="adj open">Vast</span> forms, that <span class="verb open">move</span> fantastically
<br/>To a discordant melody,
<br/>While, like a ghastly rapid river,
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">Through</span> the pale <span class="noun open">door</span>
         <br/>A hideous throng rush <span class="adv open">out</span> forever
<br/>And laugh—but smile no more.</p>
