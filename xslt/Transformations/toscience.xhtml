      <h1>TO SCIENCE
            A PROLOGUE TO "AL AARAAF"</h1>
      <p>
        Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art,
        <br/>Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
        <br/>Why <span class="verb closed">preyest</span> thou thus <span class="prep closed">upon</span> the poet's heart,
        <br/>Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
        <br/>How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
        <br/>Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
        <br/>To seek for treasure in the jewelled <span class="noun open">skies</span>,
        <br/>Albeit he <span class="verb open">soared</span> with an undaunted wing?
        <br/>Hast thou not <span class="verb closed">dragged</span> Diana from her car,
        <br/>And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
        <br/>To seek a <span class="noun closed">shelter</span> in some happier star?
        <br/>Hast thou not <span class="verb open">torn</span> the Naiad from her flood,
        <br/>The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
        <br/>The summer dream <span class="prep closed">beneath</span> the tamarind-tree?
    </p>
