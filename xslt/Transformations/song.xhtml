      <h1>SONG</h1>
      <p>
        I saw thee on thy bridal day,
        <br/>When a burning blush came <span class="prep closed">o'er</span> thee,
        <br/>Though happiness <span class="adv closed">around</span> thee <span class="verb closed">lay</span>,
        <br/>The world all love before thee;
    </p>
      <p>
        And <span class="prep closed">in</span> thine eye a kindling light
        <br/>(Whatever it might be)
        <br/>Was all on Earth my aching sight
        <br/>Of loveliness could see.
    </p>
      <p>
        That blush, perhaps, was maiden <span class="noun open">shame</span>:
        <br/>As such it well may pass,
        <br/>Though its glow hath <span class="adj open">raised</span> a fiercer flame
        <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the breast of him, alas!
    </p>
      <p>
        Who saw thee on that bridal day,
        <br/>When that deep blush would come <span class="prep closed">o'er</span> thee,
        <br/>Though happiness <span class="adv closed">around</span> thee <span class="verb closed">lay</span>,
        <br/>The world all love before thee.
    </p>
