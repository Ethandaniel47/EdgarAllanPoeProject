      <p>
            The skies they were ashen and sober;
            <br/>The leaves they were crisped and <span class="adj closed">sere</span>--
            <br/>The leaves they were <span class="verb closed">withering</span> and <span class="adj closed">sere</span>;
            <br/>It was night <span class="prep closed">in</span> the <span class="adj closed">lonesome</span> October
            <br/>Of my most immemorial year;
            <br/>It was hard by the dim lake of <span class="ref location">Auber</span>,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the misty mid region of <span class="ref location">Weir</span>--
            <br/>It was <span class="prep closed">down</span> by the <span class="adj closed">dank</span> tarn of <span class="ref location">Auber</span>,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the <span class="adj closed">ghoul-haunted</span> woodland of <span class="ref location">Weir</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            Here once, through an <span class="noun closed">alley</span> Titanic.
            <br/>Of cypress, I roamed with my <span class="noun open">Soul</span>--
            <br/>Of cypress, with <span class="ref myth">Psyche</span>, my <span class="noun open">Soul</span>.
            <br/>These were days when my heart was volcanic
            <br/>As the scoriac rivers that roll--
            <br/>As the lavas that <span class="adv open">restlessly</span> roll
            <br/>Their sulphurous currents <span class="prep closed">down</span> 
         <span class="ref location">Yaanek</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the ultimate climes of the pole--
            <br/>That groan as they roll <span class="prep closed">down</span> 
         <span class="ref location">Mount Yaanek</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the realms of the boreal pole.
        </p>
      <p>
            Our talk had been serious and sober,
            <br/>But our thoughts they were <span class="adj closed">palsied</span> and sere--
            <br/>Our memories were <span class="adj closed">treacherous</span> and sere--
            <br/>For we knew not the month was October,
            <br/>And we marked not the night of the year--
            <br/>(Ah, night of all nights <span class="prep closed">in</span> the year!)
            <br/>We noted not the dim lake of <span class="ref location">Auber</span>--
            <br/>(Though once we had journeyed <span class="prep closed">down</span> here)--
            <br/>Remembered not the <span class="adj closed">dank</span> tarn of <span class="ref location">Auber</span>,
            <br/>Nor the <span class="adj closed">ghoul-haunted</span> woodland of <span class="ref location">Weir</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            And now as the night was <span class="adj closed">senescent</span>
            <br/>And <span class="noun open">star</span>-dials pointed <span class="prep open">to</span> morn--
            <br/>As the <span class="noun open">sun</span>-dials hinted of morn--
            <br/>At the <span class="noun closed">end</span> of our path a <span class="adj open">liquescent</span>
            <br/>And <span class="adj open">nebulous</span> lustre was <span class="verb open">born</span>,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Out</span> of which a <span class="adj open">miraculous</span> crescent
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Arose</span> with a duplicate horn--
            <br/>
         <span class="ref myth">Astarte</span>'s bediamonded crescent
            <br/>Distinct with its duplicate horn.
        </p>
      <p>
            And I said--"She is warmer than <span class="ref myth">Dian</span>:
            <br/>She rolls through an ether of sighs--
            <br/>She revels <span class="prep closed">in</span> a region of sighs:
            <br/>She has seen that the tears are not dry <span class="prep closed">on</span>
            <br/>These cheeks, where the <span class="noun closed">worm</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">never</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">dies</span>,
            <br/>And has <span class="verb closed">come</span> past the <span class="noun open">stars</span> of the Lion
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> point us the path <span class="prep closed">to</span> the <span class="noun open">skies</span>--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the <span class="ref myth">Lethean</span> 
         <span class="noun open">peace</span> of the <span class="noun open">skies</span>--
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Come</span> 
         <span class="prep open">up</span>, <span class="prep closed">in</span> despite of the Lion,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> 
         <span class="verb open">shine</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">on</span> us with her bright eyes--
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Come</span> 
         <span class="prep open">up</span> through the <span class="noun closed">lair</span> of the Lion,
            <br/>With love <span class="prep closed">in</span> her luminous eyes."
        </p>
      <p>
            But <span class="ref myth">Psyche</span>, <span class="verb open">uplifting</span> her finger,
            <br/>Said--"Sadly this <span class="noun open">star</span> I mistrust--
            <br/>Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--
            <br/>Oh, <span class="verb open">hasten</span>!--oh, let us not <span class="verb closed">linger</span>!
            <br/>Oh, <span class="verb open">fly</span>!--let us <span class="verb open">fly</span>!--for we must."
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> terror she spoke, letting <span class="verb closed">sink</span> her
            <br/>
         <span class="noun open">Wings</span> till they <span class="verb closed">trailed</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> the dust--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">agony</span> sobbed, letting <span class="verb closed">sink</span> her
            <br/>Plumes till they <span class="verb closed">trailed</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> the dust--
            <br/>Till they sorrowfully <span class="verb closed">trailed</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> the dust.
        </p>
      <p>
            I replied--"This is nothing but dreaming:
            <br/>Let us <span class="prep closed">on</span> by this tremulous light!
            <br/>Let us bathe <span class="prep closed">in</span> this crystallb light!
            <br/>Its <span class="ref myth">Sibyllic</span> 
         <span class="noun open">splendor</span> is <span class="verb open">beaming</span>
            <br/>With Hope and <span class="prep closed">in</span> Beauty to-night:--
            <br/>See!--it flickers <span class="prep open">up</span> the sky through the night!
            <br/>Ah, we <span class="adv open">safely</span> may trust <span class="prep closed">to</span> its <span class="verb open">gleaming</span>,
            <br/>And be sure it will lead us <span class="prep open">aright</span>--
            <br/>We <span class="adv open">safely</span> may trust to a <span class="noun open">gleaming</span>
            <br/>That cannot but guide us <span class="prep open">aright</span>,
            <br/>Since it flickers <span class="prep open">up</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">to</span> 
         <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> through the night."
        </p>
      <p>
            Thus I <span class="verb closed">pacified</span> 
         <span class="ref myth">Psyche</span> and kissed her,
            <br/>And <span class="verb closed">tempted</span> her <span class="prep open">out</span> of her gloom--
            <br/>And <span class="verb closed">conquered</span> her scruples and gloom;
            <br/>And we passed <span class="prep closed">to</span> the <span class="noun closed">end</span> of a vista,
            <br/>But were <span class="verb closed">stopped</span> by the door of a <span class="noun closed">tomb</span>--
            <br/>By the door of a legended <span class="noun closed">tomb</span>;
            <br/>And I said--"What is written, sweet sister,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">On</span> the door of this legended <span class="noun closed">tomb</span>?"
            <br/>She replied--"Ulalume--Ulalume--
            <br/>'Tis the <span class="noun closed">vault</span> of thy <span class="adj closed">lost</span> Ulalume!"
        </p>
      <p>
            Then my heart it <span class="verb open">grew</span> ashen and sober
            <br/>As the leaves that were crisped and sere--
            <br/>As the leaves that were <span class="verb closed">withering</span> and sere;
            <br/>And I cried--"It was surely October
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">On</span> this very night of <span class="adj closed">last</span> year
            <br/>That I journeyed--I journeyed <span class="prep closed">down</span> here--
            <br/>That I <span class="verb closed">brought</span> a dread <span class="noun closed">burden</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">down</span> here!
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">On</span> this night of all nights <span class="prep closed">in</span> the year,
            <br/>Ah, what <span class="noun closed">demon</span> has <span class="verb closed">tempted</span> me here?
            <br/>Well I know, now, this dim lake of <span class="ref location">Auber</span>--
            <br/>This misty mid region of <span class="ref location">Weir</span>--
            <br/>Well I know, now, this <span class="adj closed">dank</span> tarn of <span class="ref location">Auber</span>,--
            <br/>This <span class="adj closed">ghoul-haunted</span> woodland of <span class="ref location">Weir</span>."
