             O! nothing earthly save the ray <br/> (Thrown <span class="prep closed">back</span>
            from flowers) of Beauty's eye, <br/> As <span class="prep closed">in</span> those gardens
            where the day <br/>
            <span class="verb open">Springs</span> from the gems of <span class="ref location">Circassy</span>-- <br/> O! nothing earthly save the thrill <br/> Of melody <span class="prep closed">in</span> woodland rill-- <br/> Or (music of the passion-hearted)
            <br/> Joy's voice so peacefully <span class="verb open">departed</span>
            <br/> That like the murmur <span class="prep closed">in</span> the shell, <br/> Its echo
            dwelleth and will dwell-- <br/> O! nothing of the dross of ours-- <br/> Yet all the

            world afar, afar-- <br/> The wandering star.</p>
      <p> 'Twas a sweet time for Nesace--for there <br/> Her world lay lolling on the

            <span class="prep closed">in</span> desert of the blest. <br/> Away away--'mid seas of rays
            that roll <br/> Empyrean splendor <span class="prep open">o'er</span> th' <span class="adj closed">unchained</span> soul-- <br/> The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense) <br/>
            Can struggle to its destin'd eminence-- <br/> To distant spheres, from time to time, she
            rode, <br/> And late to ours, the favour'd one of <span class="noun open">God</span>-- <br/>
            But, now, the ruler of an <span class="adj closed">anchor'd</span> realm, <br/> She throws
            aside the sceptre--leaves the helm, <br/> And, amid incense and <span class="adj open">high</span> spiritual hymns, <br/> Laves <span class="prep closed">in</span> quadruple

      <p> Now happiest, loveliest <span class="prep closed">in</span> yon lovely Earth, <br/>

            <span class="prep closed">in</span> wreaths thro' many a startled <span class="noun open">star</span>, <br/> Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar, <br/> It lit on

            about her curled-- <br/> Fit emblems of the model of her world-- <br/> Seen but <span class="prep closed">in</span> beauty--not <span class="verb closed">impeding</span> sight--
            <br/> Of other beauty glittering thro' the light-- <br/> A wreath that twined each

                <span class="verb closed">bound</span>.</p>
      <p> All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed <br/> Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd
            the head <br/> On the fair <span class="ref literary">Capo Deucato</span>, and sprang <br/> So

            budding with young bees, <br/>
            <span class="verb open">Uprear'd</span> its purple stem around her knees: <br/> And gemmy

            <span class="prep closed">In</span>

            <br/> Disconsolate linger--<span class="noun closed">grief</span> that hangs her head, <br/>
            Repenting follies that full long have <span class="verb open">fled</span>, <br/> Heaving her
            white breast to the balmy air, <br/> Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair: <br/>
            <span class="ref botanical">Nyctanthes</span> too, as <span class="adj open">sacred</span> as the

      <p> He was a goodly spirit--he who <span class="verb closed">fell</span>: <br/> A wanderer by mossy-mantled well--
            <br/> A gazer on the lights that shine <span class="prep open">above</span>-- <br/> A dreamer <span class="prep closed">in</span> the moonbeam by his
            love: <br/> What wonder? for each star is eye-like there, <br/> And looks so sweetly
            down on Beauty's hair-- <br/> And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy <br/> To his
            love-haunted heart and melancholy. <br/> The night had found (to him a night of wo)
            <br/> Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo-- <br/> Beetling it bends athwart the solemn

         <span class="prep closed">beneath</span> it lie. <br/> Here sate he with

            it upon her--but ever then <br/> It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.</p>
      <p> "Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray! <br/> How lovely 'tis to look so far
            away! <br/> She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve <br/> I left her gorgeous
            halls--nor mourned to leave, <br/> That eve--that eve--I should remember well-- <br/>
            The sun-ray dropped, <span class="prep closed">in</span> 
         <span class="ref location">Lemnos</span> with a spell <br/> On th' Arabesque carving of a gilded
            hall <br/> Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall-- <br/> And on my eyelids--O, the
            heavy light! <br/> How drowsily it weighed them <span class="prep closed">into</span> night! <br/> On flowers, before,
            and mist, and love they ran <br/> With Persian <span class="ref literary">Saadi</span> in his Gulistan: <br/> But O, that
            light!--I slumbered--<span class="noun closed">Death</span>, the while, <br/> Stole <span class="prep open">o'er</span> my senses <span class="prep closed">in</span> that lovely isle
            <br/> So softly that no single silken hair <br/> Awoke that slept--or knew that he was
            there.</p>
      <p>
             "The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon <br/> Was a proud temple called the
            Parthenon; <br/> More beauty clung around her columned wall <br/> Then even thy
            glowing bosom beats withal, <br/> And when old Time my wing did disenthral <br/>
            Thence sprang I--as the eagle from his tower, <br/> And years I left behind me <span class="prep closed">in</span> an
            hour. <br/> What time upon her airy bounds I hung, <br/> One half the garden of her
            globe was flung <br/> Unrolling as a chart unto my view-- <br/> Tenantless cities of the
            desert too! <br/> Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then, <br/> And half I wished to be again
            of men."</p>
      <p>
             "My Angelo! and why of them to be? <br/> A brighter dwelling-place is here for
            thee-- <br/> And greener fields than <span class="prep closed">in</span> yon world <span class="prep open">above</span>, <br/> And woman's
            loveliness--and passionate love." <br/> "But list, Ianthe! when the air so soft <br/>
            Failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt <span class="adj open">aloft</span>, <br/> Perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but
            the world <br/> I left so late was <span class="prep closed">into</span> chaos hurled, <br/> Sprang from her station, on
            the winds apart, <br/> And rolled a flame, the fiery <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> athwart. <br/> Methought, my
            sweet one, then I <span class="verb closed">ceased</span> to soar, <br/> And <span class="verb closed">fell</span>--not swiftly as I <span class="verb open">rose</span> before, <br/>
            But with a <span class="adj closed">downward</span>, tremulous motion thro' <br/> Light, brazen rays, this golden star
            unto! <br/> Nor long the measure of my <span class="adj closed">falling</span> hours, <br/> For nearest of all stars was
            thine to ours-- <br/> Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth, <br/> A red
            Daedalion on the timid Earth."</p>
      <p> "We came--and to thy Earth--but not to us <br/> Be given our lady's bidding to
            discuss: <br/> We came, my love; around, <span class="prep open">above</span>, <span class="prep closed">below</span>, <br/> Gay fire-fly of the night
            we come and go, <br/> Nor ask a reason save the <span class="noun open">angel</span>-nod <br/> She grants to us as
            granted by her <span class="noun open">God</span>-- <br/> But, Angelo, than thine gray Time unfurled <br/> Never his
            fairy wing <span class="prep open">o'er</span> fairer world! <br/> Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes <br/> Alone
            could see the phantom <span class="prep closed">in</span> the skies, <br/> When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
            <br/> Headlong thitherward <span class="prep open">o'er</span> the starry sea-- <br/> But when its glory swelled upon
            the sky, <br/> As glowing Beauty's bust <span class="prep closed">beneath</span> man's eye, <br/> We paused before the
            heritage of men, <br/> And thy star trembled--as doth Beauty then!"</p>
      <p>
             Thus <span class="prep closed">in</span> discourse, the lovers whiled away <br/> The night that waned and waned and
            brought no day. <br/> They <span class="verb closed">fell</span>: for <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> to them no hope imparts <br/> Who hear not
            for the beating of their hearts.</p>
