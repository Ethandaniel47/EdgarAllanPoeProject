      <h1>THE CITY IN THE SEA.</h1>
      <h2>1835</h2>
      <p>
            Lo! <span class="noun closed">Death</span> has <span class="verb open">reared</span> himself a <span class="noun open">throne</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a strange city <span class="verb closed">lying</span> 
         <span class="adv closed">alone</span>
            <br/>Far <span class="prep closed">down</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">within</span> the dim West,
            <br/>Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
            <br/>Have <span class="verb closed">gone</span> to their eternal <span class="noun closed">rest</span>.
            <br/>There shrines and palaces and towers
            <br/>(Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
            <br/>Resemble nothing that is ours.
            <br/>Around, by <span class="adj open">lifting</span> winds <span class="verb closed">forgot</span>,
            <br/>
         <span class="adv closed">Resignedly</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">beneath</span> the sky
            <br/>The melancholy waters <span class="verb closed">lie</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            No rays from the holy <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">come</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">down</span>
            <br/>On the long night-time of that town;
            <br/>But light from <span class="prep open">out</span> the lurid sea
            <br/>Streams <span class="prep open">up</span> the turrets silently--
            <br/>Gleams <span class="prep open">up</span> the pinnacles far and <span class="adj open">free</span>--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Up</span> domes--<span class="prep open">up</span> spires--<span class="prep open">up</span> kingly halls--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Up</span> fanes--<span class="prep open">up</span> Babylon-like walls--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Up</span> shadowy long-<span class="adj closed">forgotten</span> bowers
            <br/>Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Up</span> many and many a marvellous shrine
            <br/>Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
            <br/>The viol, the violet, and the vine.
        </p>
      <p>
            <span class="adv closed">Resignedly</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">beneath</span> the sky
            <br/>The melancholy waters <span class="verb closed">lie</span>.
            <br/>So blend the turrets and shadows there
            <br/>That all seem pendulous <span class="prep closed">in</span> air,
            <br/>While from a proud tower <span class="prep closed">in</span> the town
            <br/>
         <span class="noun closed">Death</span> looks gigantically <span class="prep closed">down</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            There <span class="adj open">open</span> fanes and <span class="adj open">gaping</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">graves</span>
            <br/>Yawn level with the luminous waves;
            <br/>But not the riches there that <span class="verb closed">lie</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> each idol's diamond eye--
            <br/>Not the gaily-jewelled <span class="noun closed">dead</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Tempt</span> the waters from their bed;
            <br/>For no ripples curl, alas!
            <br/>Along that wilderness of glass--
            <br/>No swellings tell that winds may be
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Upon</span> some far-off happier sea--
            <br/>No heavings hint that winds have been
            <br/>On seas less hideously serene.
        </p>
      <p>
            But lo, a stir is <span class="prep closed">in</span> the air!
            <br/>The wave--there is a movement there!
            <br/>As if the towers had <span class="verb open">thrust</span> aside,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> slightly <span class="verb closed">sinking</span>, the dull tide--
            <br/>As if their tops had feebly <span class="verb closed">given</span>
            <br/>A <span class="noun closed">void</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">within</span> the filmy <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>.
            <br/>The waves have now a redder glow--
            <br/>The hours are breathing faint and low--
            <br/>And when, amid no earthly moans,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">Down</span>, <span class="prep closed">down</span> that town shall settle hence,
            <br/>
         <span class="noun closed">Hell</span>, <span class="verb open">rising</span> from a thousand thrones,
            <br/>Shall do it reverence.
        </p>
