      <h1>THE VALLEY OF UNREST</h1>
      <h2>1831</h2>
      <p>
            Once it smiled a silent dell
            <br/>Where the people did not dwell;
            <br/>They had <span class="verb closed">gone</span> unto the wars,
            <br/>Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
            <br/>Nightly, from their azure <span class="noun closed">towers</span>,
            <br/>To keep watch <span class="prep open">above</span> the flowers,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the midst of which all day
            <br/>The red sun-light lazily lay,
            <br/>Now each visitor shall <span class="verb open">confess</span>
            <br/>The sad <span class="noun closed">valley</span>'s restlessness.
            <br/>Nothing there is motionless--
            <br/>Nothing save the airs that <span class="verb closed">brood</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Over</span> the magic <span class="noun closed">solitude</span>.
            <br/>Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
            <br/>That palpitate like the chill seas
            <br/>Around the misty <span class="ref location">Hebrides</span>!
            <br/>Ah, by no wind those clouds are <span class="verb closed">driven</span>
            <br/>That rustle through the unquiet <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="adv closed">Unceasingly</span>, from morn till even,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Over</span> the violets there that <span class="verb closed">lie</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> myriad types of the human eye--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Over</span> the lilies that wave
            <br/>And weep above a nameless <span class="noun closed">grave</span>!
            <br/>They wave:--from <span class="prep open">out</span> their fragrant tops
            <br/>
         <span class="adj open">Eternal</span> dews come <span class="prep closed">down</span> in drops.
            <br/>They weep:--from <span class="prep open">off</span> their delicate stems
            <br/>Perennial tears <span class="verb closed">descend</span> in gems.
        </p>
