      <h1>SPIRITS OF THE DEAD</h1>
      <p>
        Thy soul shall find itself <span class="adj closed">alone</span>
        <br/>Mid dark thoughts of the gray <span class="noun closed">tombstone</span>;
        <br/>Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
        <br/>Into thine hour of <span class="noun closed">secrecy</span>.
    </p>
      <p>
        Be silent in that <span class="noun closed">solitude</span>,
        <br/>Which is not <span class="noun closed">loneliness</span>â€”for then
        <br/>The spirits of the dead, who <span class="verb open">stood</span>
        <br/>In life before thee, are again
        <br/>In <span class="noun closed">death</span> 
         <span class="adv closed">around</span> thee, and their will
        <br/>Shall <span class="verb open">overshadow</span> thee; be still.
    </p>
      <p>
        The night, though clear, shall frown,
        <br/>And the stars shall look not <span class="adv closed">down</span>
        <br/>From their <span class="adj open">high</span> thrones in the <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>
        <br/>With light like hope to mortals given,
        <br/>But their red orbs, without beam,
        <br/>To thy weariness shall seem
        <br/>As a burning and a fever
        <br/>Which would <span class="verb closed">cling</span> to thee forever.
    </p>
      <p>
        Now are thoughts thou shalt not <span class="verb closed">banish</span>,
        <br/>Now are visions ne'er to <span class="verb closed">vanish</span>;
        <br/>From thy spirit shall they pass
        <br/>No more, like dewdrops from the grass.
    </p>
      <p>
        The breeze, the breath of God, is still,
        <br/>And the mist <span class="prep open">upon</span> the hill
        <br/>Shadowy, shadowy, yet <span class="adj open">unbroken</span>,
        <br/>Is a symbol and a token.
        <br/>How it <span class="verb open">hangs</span> upon the trees,
        <br/>A mystery of mysteries!
    </p>
