      <h1>A DREAM</h1>
      <h2>1837</h2>
      <p>
            <span class="prep closed">In</span> visions of the dark night
            <br/>I have dreamed of joy <span class="verb open">departed</span>--
            <br/>But a waking dream of life and light
            <br/>Hath <span class="verb open">left</span> me <span class="adj open">broken</span>-hearted.
        </p>
      <p>
            Ah! what is not a dream by day
            <br/>To him whose eyes are cast
            <br/>On things around him with a ray
            <br/>Turned back <span class="prep open">upon</span> the past?
        </p>
      <p>
            That holy dream--that holy dream,
            <br/>While all the world were chiding,
            <br/>Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
            <br/>A <span class="adj closed">lonely</span> spirit guiding.
        </p>
      <p>
            What though that light, thro' storm and night,
            <br/>So trembled from afar--
            <br/>What could there be more purely bright
            <br/>In Truth's day <span class="noun open">star</span>?
        </p>
