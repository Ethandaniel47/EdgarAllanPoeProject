      <h1>LENORE</h1>
      <h2>1884</h2>
      <p>
            Ah, <span class="verb open">broken</span> is the golden bowl! the <span class="noun open">spirit</span> 
         <span class="verb open">flown</span> forever!
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Let</span> the bell <span class="verb open">toll</span>!--a <span class="adj open">saintly</span> 
         <span class="noun open">soul</span> 
         <span class="verb open">floats</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">on</span> the <span class="ref myth">Stygian</span> river.
            <br/>And, <span class="ref persName">Guy de Vere</span>, hast thou no tear?--weep now or <span class="noun closed">never</span> more!
            <br/>See! <span class="prep closed">on</span> yon drear and rigid bier <span class="adv closed">low</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">lies</span> thy love, Lenore!
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Come</span>! <span class="verb ">let</span> the <span class="noun closed">burial</span> rite be read--the <span class="noun closed">funeral</span> song be sung!--
            <br/>An anthem for the queenliest <span class="noun closed">dead</span> that ever <span class="verb closed">died</span> so young--
            <br/>A <span class="noun closed">dirge</span> for her, the doubly <span class="noun closed">dead</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> that she <span class="verb closed">died</span> so young.
        </p>
      <p>
            "Wretches! ye <span class="verb open">loved</span> her for her <span class="adj open">wealth</span> and <span class="verb closed">hated</span> her for her pride,
            <br/>And when she <span class="verb closed">fell</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> feeble health, ye <span class="verb open">blessed</span> her--that she <span class="verb closed">died</span>!
            <br/>How shall the ritual, then, be read?--the <span class="noun closed">requiem</span> how be sung
            <br/>By you--by yours, the <span class="adj closed">evil</span> eye,--by yours, the <span class="adj closed">slanderous</span> tongue
            <br/>That did <span class="prep closed">to</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">death</span> the <span class="noun open">innocence</span> that <span class="verb closed">died</span>, and <span class="verb closed">died</span> so young?"
        </p>
      <p>
            <span class="foreign ">Peccavimus</span>; but <span class="verb open">rave</span> not thus! and <span class="verb open">let</span> a <span class="ref religious">Sabbath</span> song
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Go</span> 
         <span class="prep open">up</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">to</span> 
         <span class="noun open">God</span> so <span class="adv closed">solemnly</span> the <span class="noun closed">dead</span> may feel no <span class="noun closed">wrong</span>!
            <br/>The sweet Lenore hath "<span class="verb open">gone</span> before," with <span class="noun open">Hope</span>, that <span class="verb open">flew</span> beside,
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Leaving</span> thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--
            <br/>For her, the fair and <span class="foreign ">débonnaire</span>, that now so <span class="adv closed">lowly</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">lies</span>,
            <br/>The life <span class="prep open">upon</span> her yellow hair but not <span class="prep closed">within</span> her eyes--
            <br/>The life still there, <span class="prep open">upon</span> her hair--the <span class="noun closed">death</span> 
         <span class="prep open">upon</span> her eyes.
        </p>
      <p>
            "<span class="verb open">Avaunt</span>! to-night my heart is <span class="adj open">light</span>. No <span class="noun closed">dirge</span> will I <span class="verb open">upraise</span>,
            <br/>But <span class="verb open">waft</span> the <span class="noun open">angel</span> 
         <span class="prep open">on</span> her <span class="noun open">flight</span> with a pæan of old days!
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Let</span> no bell <span class="verb open">toll</span>!--lest her sweet <span class="noun open">soul</span>, <span class="prep closed">amid</span> its <span class="adj open">hallowed</span> mirth,
            <br/>Should <span class="verb closed">catch</span> the note, as it doth float <span class="prep open">up</span> 
         <span class="prep open">from</span> the <span class="adj closed">damned</span> Earth.
            <br/>To friends <span class="prep open">above</span>, <span class="prep open">from</span> fiends <span class="prep closed">below</span>, the indignant <span class="noun closed">ghost</span> is <span class="verb open">riven</span>--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">Hell</span> unto a <span class="adj open">high</span> estate far <span class="prep open">up</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">within</span> the <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">grief</span> and groan <span class="prep closed">to</span> a golden <span class="noun open">throne</span> beside the King of <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>."
