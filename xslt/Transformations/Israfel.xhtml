      <h1>ISRAFEL</h1>
      <h2>1836</h2>
      <p>
            <span class="prep closed">In</span> 
         <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> a spirit doth dwell
            <br/>"Whose heart-strings are a lute;"
            <br/>None sing so wildly well
            <br/>As the <span class="noun closed">angel</span> 
         <span class="ref biblical">Israfel</span>,
            <br/>And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Ceasing</span> their hymns, attend the spell
            <br/>Of his voice, all mute.
        </p>
      <p>
            Tottering <span class="prep open">above</span>
            <br/>In her <span class="adj open">highest</span> noon,
            <br/>The enamoured Moon
            <br/>Blushes with love,
            <br/>While, to listen, the red levin
            <br/>(With the rapid <span class="ref astrological">Pleiads</span>, even,
            <br/>Which were seven),
            <br/>Pauses <span class="prep closed">in</span> 
         <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            And they say (the starry choir
            <br/>And the other listening things)
            <br/>That <span class="ref biblical">Israfeli's</span> fire
            <br/>Is owing to that lyre
            <br/>By which he sits and sings--
            <br/>The trembling living wire
            <br/>Of those unusual strings.
        </p>
      <p>
            But the skies that <span class="noun open">angel</span> trod,
            <br/>Where <span class="adj closed">deep</span> thoughts are a duty--
            <br/>Where Love's a grow-up <span class="noun open">God</span>--
            <br/>Where the <span class="ref religious">Houri</span> glances are
            <br/>Imbued with all the beauty
            <br/>Which we worship <span class="prep closed">in</span> a <span class="noun open">star</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            Therefore, thou art not wrong,
            <br/>
         <span class="ref biblical">Israfeli</span>, who despisest
            <br/>An unimpassioned song;
            <br/>To thee the laurels belong,
            <br/>Best bard, because the wisest!
            <br/>Merrily live and long!
        </p>
      <p>
            The ecstasies <span class="prep open">above</span>
            <br/>With thy burning measures suit--
            <br/>Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
            <br/>With the fervor of thy lute--
            <br/>Well may the <span class="noun open">stars</span> be mute!
        </p>
      <p>
            Yes, <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> is thine; but this
            <br/>Is a world of sweets and sours;
            <br/>Our flowers are merely--flowers,
            <br/>And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
            <br/>Is the sunshine of ours.
        </p>
      <p>
            If I could dwell
            <br/>Where <span class="ref biblical">Israfel</span>
            <br/>Hath dwelt, and he where I,
            <br/>He might not sing so wildly well
            <br/>A mortal melody,
            <br/>While a bolder note than this might <span class="verb open">swell</span>
            <br/>From my lyre <span class="prep closed">within</span> the sky.
        </p>
