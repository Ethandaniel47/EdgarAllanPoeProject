      <h1>(2) To Marie Louise (Shew)</h1>
      <p>
        Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
        <br/>In the mad pride of intellectuality,
        <br/>Maintained "the power of words"—denied that ever
        <br/>A thought <span class="verb open">arose</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">within</span> the human brain
        <br/>Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
        <br/>And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
        <br/>Two words—two foreign soft dissyllables—
        <br/>Italian tones, made only to be murmured
        <br/>By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
        <br/>That <span class="verb open">hangs</span> like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"—
        <br/>Have stirred from out the <span class="noun closed">abysses</span> of his heart,
        <br/>Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
        <br/>Richer, far wilder, far <span class="adj open">diviner</span> visions
        <br/>Than even the <span class="ref biblical">seraph</span> harper, <span class="ref biblical">Israfel</span>,
        <br/>(Who has "the sweetest voice of all <span class="ref biblical">God's</span> creatures,")
        <br/>Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are <span class="adj open">broken</span>.
        <br/>The pen <span class="verb closed">falls</span> powerless from my shivering hand.
        <br/>With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
        <br/>I cannot write—I cannot speak or think—
        <br/>Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
        <br/>This standing <span class="adj closed">motionless</span> upon the golden
        <br/>Threshold of the <span class="adj open">wide-open</span> gate of dreams,
        <br/>Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous <span class="foreign ">vista</span>,
        <br/>And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
        <br/>Upon the left, and all the way along,
        <br/>Amid empurpled vapors, far away
        <br/>To where the prospect <span class="verb closed">terminates</span>—thee only!
    </p>
