      <h1>Marie Louise (Shew)</h1>
      <h2>1847</h2>
      <p>
        Of all who hail thy presence as the morning;
        <br/>Of all to whom thine absence is the night,
        <br/>The <span class="verb closed">blotting</span> utterly from out <span class="adj open">high</span> 
         <span class="ref biblical">heaven</span>
        <br/>The sacred sun; of all who, weeping, bless thee
        <br/>Hourly for hope, for life, ah! <span class="prep open">above</span> all,
        <br/>For the resurrection of <span class="verb closed">deep-buried</span> faith
        <br/>In truth, in virtue, in humanity;
        <br/>Of all who, on despair's <span class="foreign ">unhallowed</span> bed
        <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Lying</span> 
         <span class="adv closed">down</span> to die, have suddenly arisen
        <br/>At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!"
        <br/>At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
        <br/>In the <span class="foreign ">seraphic</span> glancing of thine eyes;
        <br/>Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
        <br/>Nearest resembles worship, oh, remember
        <br/>The truest, the most fervently devoted,
        <br/>And think that these <span class="adj closed">weak</span> lines are written by him:
        <br/>By him, who, as he pens them, thrills to think
        <br/>His spirit is communing with an <span class="ref biblical">angel's</span>.
