      <h1>ROMANCE</h1>
      <p>
        Romance, who loves to nod and sing
        <br/>With drowsy head and <span class="verb closed">folded</span> wing
        <br/>Among the green leaves as they shake
        <br/>Far <span class="adv closed">down</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">within</span> some shadowy lake,
        <br/>To me a painted <span class="foreign ">paroquet</span>
        <br/>Hath been—a most familiar bird—
        <br/>Taught me my alphabet to say,
        <br/>To lisp my very earliest word
        <br/>While in the wild-wood I did <span class="verb closed">lie</span>,
        <br/>A child—with a most knowing eye.
    </p>
      <p>
        Of late, eternal <span class="foreign ">condor</span> years
        <br/>So shake the very <span class="noun open">heaven</span> on high
        <br/>With <span class="foreign ">tumult</span> as they thunder by,
        <br/>I have no time for idle cares
        <br/>Through gazing on the unquiet sky;
        <br/>And when an hour with calmer wings
        <br/>Its <span class="adv closed">down</span> upon my spirit <span class="verb closed">flings</span>,
        <br/>That little time with lyre and rhyme
        <br/>To while away—<span class="adj closed">forbidden</span> things—
        <br/>My heart would feel to be a crime
        <br/>Unless it trembled with the strings.
