            It was many and many a year ago,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">In</span> a kingdom by the sea,
            <br/>That a maiden there lived whom you may know
            <br/>By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
            <br/>And this maiden she lived with no other thought
            <br/>Than to love and be loved by me.
        </p>
      <p>
            I was a child and she was a child,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">In</span> this kingdom by the sea:
            <br/>But we loved with a love that was more than love--
            <br/>I and my ANNABEL LEE;
            <br/>With a love that the <span class="adj closed">winged</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">seraphs</span> of <span class="noun closed">heaven</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Coveted</span> her and me.
        </p>
      <p>
            And this was the reason that, long ago,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">In</span> this kingdom by the sea,
            <br/>A wind <span class="verb closed">blew</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">out</span> of a cloud, chilling
            <br/>My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            <br/>So that her highborn kinsmen <span class="verb open">came</span>
            <br/>And <span class="verb open">bore</span> her <span class="prep closed">away</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">from</span> me,
            <br/>To <span class="verb open">shut</span> her <span class="prep closed">up</span> 
         <span class="prep open">in</span> a <span class="noun open">sepulchre</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">In</span> this kingdom by the sea.
        </p>
      <p>
            The <span class="noun closed">angels</span>, not half so happy <span class="prep open">in</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">heaven</span>,
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Went</span> envying her and me--
            <br/>Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">In</span> this kingdom by the sea)
            <br/>That the wind <span class="verb open">came</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">out</span> of the cloud by night,
            <br/>Chilling and <span class="verb open">killing</span> my ANNABEL LEE.
        </p>
      <p>
            But our love it was stronger by far than the love
            <br/>Of those who were older than we--
            <br/>Of many far wiser than we--
            <br/>And neither the <span class="noun closed">angels</span> 
         <span class="prep open">in</span> 
         <span class="noun closed">heaven</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">above</span>,
            <br/>Nor the <span class="noun open">demons</span> 
         <span class="prep open">down</span> 
         <span class="prep open">under</span> the sea,
            <br/>Can ever <span class="verb closed">dissever</span> my <span class="noun closed">soul</span> from the <span class="noun closed">soul</span>
            <br/>Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.
        </p>
      <p>
            For the <span class="noun closed">moon</span> never <span class="verb closed">beams</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">without</span> 
         <span class="verb open">bringing</span> me dreams
            <br/>Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            <br/>And the <span class="noun closed">stars</span> never <span class="verb closed">rise</span> but I see the bright eyes
            <br/>Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            <br/>And so, all the night-tide, I <span class="verb open">lie</span> 
         <span class="prep open">down</span> by the side
            <br/>Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">In</span> her <span class="noun open">sepulchre</span> there by the sea--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">In</span> her <span class="noun open">tomb</span> by the side of the sea.
