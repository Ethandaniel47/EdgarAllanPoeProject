      <h1>THE BELLS</h1>
      <h2>1849</h2>
      <p>
            I.
            <br/>Hear the sledges with the bells--
            <br/>Silver bells!
            <br/>What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
            <br/>How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> their icy air of night!
            <br/>While the <span class="noun open">stars</span>, that oversprinkle
            <br/>All the <span class="noun open">heavens</span>, seem to twinkle
            <br/>With a crystallb delight;
            <br/>Keeping time, time, time,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a sort of Runic rhyme,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the tintinnabulation that so musically <span class="verb closed">wells</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> the bells, bells, bells, bells,
            <br/>Bells, bells, bells--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> the jingling and the tinkling of the
                bells.
        </p>
      <p>
            II.
            <br/>Hear the mellow wedding bells,
            <br/>Golden bells!
            <br/>What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
            <br/>Through the balmy air of night
            <br/>How they ring <span class="prep open">out</span> their delight!
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> the molten golden-notes,
            <br/>And all <span class="prep closed">in</span> tune,
            <br/>What a liquid ditty <span class="verb open">floats</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the turtle-dove that listens, while she
                gloats
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">On</span> the <span class="noun open">moon</span>!
            <br/>Oh, <span class="prep open">from</span>
                <span class="prep open">out</span> the sounding <span class="noun closed">cells</span>,
            <br/>What a <span class="noun open">gush</span> of euphony voluminously <span class="verb closed">wells</span>!
            <br/>How it <span class="verb closed">swells</span>!
            <br/>How it <span class="verb closed">dwells</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">On</span> the future! how it tells
            <br/>Of the <span class="noun open">rapture</span> that <span class="verb open">impels</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the swinging and the ringing
            <br/>Of the bells, bells, bells,
            <br/>Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
            <br/>Bells, bells, bells--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!
        </p>
      <p>
            III.
            <br/>Hear the loud alarum bells--
            <br/>Brazen bells!
            <br/>What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the startled ear of night
            <br/>How they scream <span class="prep open">out</span> their affright!
            <br/>Too much horrified to speak,
            <br/>They can only <span class="verb open">shriek</span>, <span class="verb open">shriek</span>,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">Out</span> of tune,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a clamorous appealing <span class="prep closed">to</span> the <span class="noun open">mercy</span> of the fire,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic
                fire
            <br/>
         <span class="verb open">Leaping</span>
                <span class="prep open">higher</span>, <span class="prep open">higher</span>, <span class="prep open">higher</span>,
            <br/>With a desperate desire,
            <br/>And a resolute endeavor
            <br/>Now--now <span class="prep closed">to</span> sit or <span class="prep closed">never</span>,
            <br/>By the side of the pale-faced <span class="noun open">moon</span>.
            <br/>Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
            <br/>What a tale their terror tells
            <br/>Of Despair!
            <br/>How they clang, and clash, and roar!
            <br/>What a horror they <span class="verb open">outpour</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">On</span> the bosom of the palpitating air!
            <br/>Yet the ear it fully knows,
            <br/>By the twanging,
            <br/>And the clanging,
            <br/>How the danger <span class="verb closed">ebbs</span> and <span class="verb open">flows</span>;
            <br/>Yet the ear distinctly tells,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the jangling,
            <br/>And the wrangling,
            <br/>How the <span class="noun closed">danger</span>
                <span class="verb closed">sinks</span> and <span class="verb closed">swells</span>,
            <br/>By the <span class="verb closed">sinking</span> or the <span class="verb closed">swelling</span>
                <span class="prep closed">in</span> the anger of the bells--
            <br/>Of the bells--
            <br/>Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
            <br/>Bells, bells, bells--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the clamor and the clangor of the bells!
        </p>
      <p>
            IV.
            <br/>Hear the tolling of the bells--
            <br/>Iron bells!
            <br/>What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> the silence of the night,
            <br/>How we shiver with affright
            <br/>At the melancholy menace of their tone!
            <br/>For every sound that <span class="verb open">floats</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> the rust <span class="prep closed">within</span>
                their throats
            <br/>Is a groan.
            <br/>And the people--ah, the people--
            <br/>They that <span class="verb closed">dwell</span>
                <span class="prep open">up</span>
                <span class="prep closed">in</span> the steeple.
            <br/>All alone,
            <br/>And who toiling, toiling, toiling,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> that muffled monotone,
            <br/>Feel a <span class="noun open">glory</span>
                <span class="prep closed">in</span> so rolling
            <br/>
         <span class="prep open">On</span> the human heart a stone--
            <br/>They are neither man nor woman--
            <br/>They are neither brute nor human--
            <br/>They are <span class="noun closed">Ghouls</span>:
            <br/>And their king it is who tolls;
            <br/>And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
            <br/>Rolls
            <br/>A pæan from the bells!
            <br/>And his merry bosom <span class="verb closed">swells</span>
            <br/>With the pæan of the bells!
            <br/>And he dances, and he yells;
            <br/>Keeping time, time, time,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a sort of Runic rhyme,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the pæan of the bells--
            <br/>Of the bells:
            <br/>Keeping time, time, time,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a sort of Runic rhyme,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the throbbing of the bells--
            <br/>Of the bells, bells, bells--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the sobbing of the bells;
            <br/>Keeping time, time, time,
            <br/>As he knells, knells, knells,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a happy Runic rhyme,
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the rolling of the bells--
            <br/>Of the bells, bells, bells--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the tolling of the bells,
            <br/>Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
            <br/>Bells, bells, bells--
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">To</span> the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
