      <h1>"In Youth I have Known One"</h1>
      <p>
        How often we forget all time, when lone
        <br/>Admiring Nature's universal throne;
        <br/>Her <span class="noun open">woods</span>—her <span class="noun open">wilds</span>—her <span class="noun open">mountains</span>—the intense
        <br/>Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!
    </p>
      <p>
        In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
        <br/>In secret communing held—as he with it,
        <br/>In <span class="noun open">daylight</span>, and in beauty, from his birth:
        <br/>Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
        <br/>From the <span class="noun open">sun</span> and <span class="noun open">stars</span>, whence he had drawn forth
        <br/>A passionate <span class="noun open">light</span> such for his spirit was fit—
        <br/>And yet that spirit knew—not in the hour
        <br/>Of its own fervor—what had <span class="prep closed">o'er</span> it power.
    </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
        <br/>To a ferver by the moonbeam that hangs <span class="prep closed">o'er</span>,
        <br/>But I will half believe that wild <span class="noun open">light</span> fraught
        <br/>With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
        <br/>Hath ever told—or is it of a thought
        <br/>The <span class="adj open">unembodied</span> essence, and no more
        <br/>That with a quickening spell doth <span class="prep closed">o'er</span> us pass
        <br/>As dew of the <span class="noun closed">night-time</span>, <span class="prep closed">o'er</span> the summer grass?
    </p>
      <p>
        Doth <span class="prep closed">o'er</span> us pass, when, as th' <span class="verb open">expanding</span> eye
        <br/>To the loved object—so the tear to the <span class="noun closed">lid</span>
        <br/>Will start, which lately <span class="verb closed">slept</span> in apathy?
        <br/>And yet it need not be—(that object) <span class="adj closed">hid</span>
        <br/>From us in life—but common—which doth <span class="verb closed">lie</span>
        <br/>Each hour before us—but then only bid
        <br/>With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken
        <br/>T' <span class="verb open">awake</span> us—'Tis a symbol and a token—
    </p>
      <p>
        Of what in other worlds shall be—and given
        <br/>In beauty by our <span class="ref rel">God</span>, to those alone
        <br/>Who otherwise would <span class="verb closed">fall</span> from life and <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>
        <br/>Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
        <br/>That <span class="adj open">high</span> tone of the spirit which hath striven
        <br/>Though not with Faith—with godliness—whose throne
        <br/>With desperate energy 't hath beaten <span class="adv closed">down</span>;
        <br/>Wearing its own <span class="adj closed">deep</span> feeling as a crown.
