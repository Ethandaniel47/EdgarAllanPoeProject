      <h1>"The Happiest Day"</h1>
      <h2>1827</h2>
      <p>
        The <span class="adj open">happiest</span> day—the <span class="adj open">happiest</span> hour
        <br/>My seared and <span class="verb closed">blighted</span> heart hath known,
        <br/>The <span class="adj open">highest</span> hope of pride and power,
        <br/>I feel hath <span class="verb open">flown</span>.
    </p>
      <p>
        Of <span class="noun open">power</span>! said I? Yes! such I ween
        <br/>But they have <span class="verb closed">vanished</span> long, alas!
        <br/>The visions of my youth have been—
        <br/>But let them pass.
    </p>
      <p>
        And pride, what have I now with thee?
        <br/>Another brow may ev'n inherit
        <br/>The venom thou hast <span class="verb closed">poured</span> on me—
        <br/>Be still my spirit!
    </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="adj open">happiest</span> day—the <span class="adj open">happiest</span> hour
        <br/>Mine eyes shall see—have ever seen
        <br/>The brightest glance of pride and power
        <br/>I feel have been:
    </p>
      <p>
        But were that hope of pride and <span class="noun closed">power</span>
        <br/>Now offered with the <span class="noun closed">pain</span>
        <br/>Ev'n then I felt—that brightest hour
        <br/>I would not live again:
    </p>
      <p>
        For on its wing was dark alloy
        <br/>And as it fluttered—<span class="verb closed">fell</span>
        <br/>An essence—powerful to <span class="verb closed">destroy</span>
        <br/>A soul that knew it well.
    </p>
