      <h2>1827</h2>
      <p>
        In spring of youth it was my lot
        <br/>To <span class="verb closed">haunt</span> of the wide world a spot
        <br/>The which I could not love the less—
        <br/>So lovely was the <span class="adj closed">loneliness</span>
        <br/>Of a wild lake, with black rock <span class="verb closed">bound</span>,
        <br/>And the <span class="adj open">tall</span> pines that <span class="verb open">towered</span> 
         <span class="adv closed">around</span>.
    </p>
      <p>
        But when the Night had thrown her pall
        <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">Upon</span> the spot, as <span class="prep closed">upon</span> all,
        <br/>And the mystic wind went by
        <br/>Murmuring in melody—
        <br/>Then—ah, then, I would <span class="verb open">awake</span>
        <br/>To the <span class="noun closed">terror</span> of the lone lake.
    </p>
      <p>
        Yet that <span class="noun closed">terror</span> was not fright,
        <br/>But a tremulous delight—
        <br/>A feeling not the jewelled mine
        <br/>Could <span class="verb open">teach</span> or <span class="verb closed">bribe</span> me to define—
        <br/>Nor Love—although the Love were thine.
    </p>
      <p>
         <span class="noun open">Death</span> was in that poisonous wave,
       <br/>And in its gulf a fitting <span class="noun closed">grave</span>
         <br/>For him who thence could solace bring
       <br/>To his lone imagining—
       <br/>Whose <span class="adj closed">solitary</span> soul could make
       <br/>An <span class="ref biblical">Eden</span> of that dim lake.
