      <h2>1845</h2>
      <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
<br/>
         <span class="prep open">Over</span> many a quaint and curious volume of <span class="adj closed">forgotten</span> lore--
<br/>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
<br/>As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door.
<br/>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door--
<br/>Only this and nothing more."</p>
      <p>Ah, distinctly I remember, it was <span class="prep closed">in</span> the bleak December,
<br/>And each <span class="adj open">separate</span> 
         <span class="adj closed">dying</span> ember wrought its <span class="noun closed">ghost</span> upon the floor.
<br/>Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
<br/>From my books <span class="verb closed">surcease</span> of sorrow--sorrow for the <span class="adj closed">lost</span> Lenore--
<br/>For the rare and <span class="adj open">radiant</span> maiden whom the <span class="noun open">angels</span> name Lenore--
<br/>Nameless here for <span class="noun open">evermore</span>.</p>
      <p>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
<br/>Thrilled me--<span class="verb open">filled</span> me with fantastic terrors <span class="adv closed">never</span> felt before;
<br/>So that now, to <span class="verb closed">still</span> the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
<br/>"'Tis some visitor entreating <span class="noun open">entrance</span> at my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door--
<br/>Some late visitor entreating <span class="noun open">entrance</span> at my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door;--
<br/>This it is and nothing more."</p>
      <p>Presently my soul <span class="verb open">grew</span> stronger; <span class="verb closed">hesitating</span> then no longer,
<br/>"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
<br/>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
<br/>And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door,
<br/>That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I <span class="verb open">opened</span> 
         <span class="adv open">wide</span> the door:--
<br/>Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="adj closed">Deep</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">into</span> that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
<br/>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
<br/>But the silence was <span class="verb closed">unbroken</span>, and the darkness gave no token,
<br/>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
<br/>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
<br/>Merely this and nothing more.</p>
      <p>Back <span class="prep closed">into</span> the <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> turning, all my soul <span class="prep closed">within</span> me burning,
<br/>Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.
<br/>"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
<br/>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--
<br/>Let my heart be <span class="adj closed">still</span> a moment, and this mystery explore;--
<br/>'Tis the wind and nothing more."</p>
      <p>
         <span class="adj open">Open</span> here I <span class="verb open">flung</span> the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
<br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
<br/>Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant <span class="verb closed">stopped</span> or <span class="verb closed">stayed</span> he;
<br/>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched <span class="prep open">above</span> my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door--
<br/>Perched upon a bust of <span class="ref mythological">Pallas</span> just <span class="prep open">above</span> my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door--
<br/>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
      <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy <span class="prep closed">into</span> smiling,
<br/>By the <span class="noun closed">grave</span> and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
<br/>"Though thy crest be <span class="adj open">shorn</span> and <span class="adj open">shaven</span>, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
<br/>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--
<br/>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's <span class="ref mythological">Plutonian</span> shore!"
<br/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
<br/>Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
<br/>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
<br/>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird <span class="prep open">above</span> his <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door--
<br/>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust <span class="prep open">above</span> his <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door,
<br/>With such name as "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
<br/>That one word, as if his soul <span class="prep closed">in</span> that one word he did <span class="verb open">outpour</span>.
<br/>Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
<br/>Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have <span class="verb open">flown</span> before--
<br/>On the morrow he will <span class="verb open">leave</span> me, as my hopes have <span class="verb open">flown</span> before."
<br/>Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>Startled at the stillness <span class="verb open">broken</span> by reply so aptly spoken,
<br/>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
<br/>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
<br/>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one <span class="noun closed">burden</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">bore</span>--
<br/>Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy <span class="noun closed">burden</span> 
         <span class="verb closed">bore</span>
         <br/>Of 'Never--nevermore.'"</p>
      <p>But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul <span class="prep closed">into</span> smiling,
<br/>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat <span class="prep closed">in</span> front of bird and bust and door;
<br/>Then, upon the velvet <span class="verb closed">sinking</span>, I betook myself to <span class="verb closed">linking</span>
         <br/>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
<br/>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
<br/>Meant <span class="prep closed">in</span> croaking "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>This I sat engaged <span class="prep closed">in</span> guessing, but no syllable expressing
<br/>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned <span class="prep closed">into</span> my bosom's <span class="noun closed">core</span>;
<br/>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
<br/>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated <span class="prep open">o'er</span>,
<br/>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating <span class="prep open">o'er</span>,
<br/>She shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
      <p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
<br/>Swung by <span class="ref biblical">Seraphim</span> whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
<br/>"Wretch," I cried, "thy <span class="noun open">God</span> hath lent thee--by these <span class="noun open">angels</span> he hath sent thee
<br/>
         <span class="noun open">Respite</span>--<span class="noun open">respite</span> aad <span class="ref greek">nepenthé</span> from thy memories of Lenore!
<br/>Quaff, oh quaff this kind <span class="ref greek">nepenthé</span>, and <span class="verb closed">forget</span> this <span class="adj closed">lost</span> Lenore!"
<br/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or <span class="noun closed">devil</span>!--
<br/>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
<br/>
         <span class="adj closed">Desolate</span> yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
<br/>On this home by Horror <span class="verb closed">haunted</span>--tell me truly, I implore--
<br/>Is there--is there balm in <span class="ref location">Gilead</span>?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"
<br/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or <span class="noun closed">devil</span>!
<br/>By that <span class="noun open">Heaven</span> that bends <span class="prep open">above</span> us--by that <span class="noun open">God</span> we both adore--
<br/>Tell this soul with sorrow <span class="verb closed">laden</span> if, <span class="prep closed">within</span> the distant <span class="ref location">Aidenn</span>,
<br/>It shall <span class="verb closed">clasp</span> a sainted maiden whom the <span class="noun open">angels</span> name Lenore--
<br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Clasp</span> a rare and <span class="adj open">radiant</span> maiden whom the <span class="noun open">angels</span> name Lenore."
<br/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>"Be that word our sign of <span class="noun open">parting</span>, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--
<br/>"Get thee back <span class="prep closed">into</span> the tempest and the Night's <span class="ref mythological">Plutonian</span> shore!
<br/>
         <span class="verb open">Leave</span> no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
<br/>
         <span class="verb open">Leave</span> my loneliness <span class="adj closed">unbroken</span>!--<span class="verb open">quit</span> the bust <span class="prep open">above</span> my door!
<br/>Take thy beak from <span class="prep open">out</span> my heart, and take thy form from <span class="prep open">off</span> my door!"
<br/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
      <p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
<br/>On the pallid bust of <span class="ref mythological">Pallas</span> just <span class="prep open">above</span> my <span class="noun closed">chamber</span> door;
<br/>And his eyes have all the seeming of a <span class="noun closed">demon</span>'s that is dreaming,
<br/>And the lamp-light <span class="prep open">o'er</span> him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
<br/>And my soul from <span class="prep open">out</span> that shadow that lies floating on the floor
<br/>Shall be <span class="verb open">lifted</span>--nevermore!</p>
