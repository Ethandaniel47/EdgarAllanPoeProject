        There are some qualities—some incorporate things,
        <br/>That have a double life, which thus is made
        <br/>A type of that twin entity which springs
        <br/>
         <span class="prep open">From</span> matter and <span class="noun open">light</span>, <span class="verb open">evinced</span> in <span class="noun closed">solid</span> and <span class="noun closed">shade</span>.
        <br/>There is a twofold <span class="noun closed">Silence</span>—<span class="noun open">sea</span> and <span class="noun open">shore</span>—
        <br/>Body and soul. One dwells in <span class="adj closed">lonely</span> places,
        <br/>Newly with grass <span class="adj closed">o'ergrown</span>; some solemn graces,
        <br/>Some human memories and tearful lore,
        <br/>Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
        <br/>He is the corporate <span class="noun closed">Silence</span>: dread him not!
        <br/>No power hath he of evil <span class="prep closed">in</span> himself;
        <br/>But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
        <br/>Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
        <br/>That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
        <br/>No foot of man), commend thyself to God!
