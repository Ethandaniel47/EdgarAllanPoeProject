      <h1>Imitation</h1>
      <h2>1827</h2>
      <p>
        A <span class="adj closed">dark</span> unfathomed tide
        <br/>Of interminable prideâ€”
        <br/>A <span class="noun closed">mystery</span>, and a dream,
        <br/>Should my early life seem;
        <br/>I say that dream was <span class="adj closed">fraught</span>
        <br/>With a <span class="adj open">wild</span> and <span class="noun open">waking</span> thought
        <br/>Of beings that have been,
        <br/>Which my spirit hath not seen,
        <br/>Had I let them pass me by,
        <br/>With a dreaming eye!
        <br/>Let none of earth inherit
        <br/>That vision on my spirit;
        <br/>Those thoughts I would <span class="verb closed">control</span>,
        <br/>As a spell <span class="prep closed">upon</span> his soul:
        <br/>For that bright hope at last
        <br/>And that light time have past,
        <br/>And my wordly <span class="noun closed">rest</span> hath gone
        <br/>With a sigh as it passed on:
        <br/>I care not though it <span class="verb closed">perish</span>
        <br/>With a thought I then did <span class="verb open">cherish</span>.
