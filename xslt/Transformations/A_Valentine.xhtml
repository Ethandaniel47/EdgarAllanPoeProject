      <h1>A VALENTINE</h1>
      <h2>1846</h2>
      <p>
            For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
            <br/>Brightly <span class="adj closed">expressive</span> as the twins of <span class="ref myth">Leda</span>,
            <br/>Shall <span class="verb closed">find</span> her own sweet name, that, nestling <span class="verb open">lies</span>
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">Upon</span> the page, <span class="verb open">enwrapped</span> from every reader.
            <br/>Search narrowly the lbs!--they <span class="verb open">hold</span> a treasure
            <br/>Divine--a talisman--an amulet
            <br/>That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure--
            <br/>The words--the syllables! Do not forget
            <br/>The trivialest point, or you may <span class="verb closed">lose</span> your labor!
            <br/>And yet there is <span class="prep open">in</span> this no Gordian <span class="noun open">knot</span>
            <br/>Which one might not <span class="verb closed">undo</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">without</span> a sabre,
            <br/>If one could merely comprehend the plot.
            <br/>Enwritten <span class="prep closed">upon</span> the leaf where now are peering
            <br/>Eyes scintillating <span class="noun closed">soul</span>, there <span class="verb open">lie</span> 
         <span class="adv open">perdus</span>
            <br/>Three eloquent words oft uttered <span class="prep open">in</span> the hearing
            <br/>Of poets by poets--as the name is a poet's, too.
            <br/>Its letters, although naturally <span class="verb open">lying</span>
            <br/>Like the knight <span class="ref historical">Pinto--Mendez Ferdinando</span>--
            <br/>Still form a synonym for Truth--<span class="verb open">Cease</span> trying!
            <br/>You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.
