      <p>
            Thank <span class="noun open">Heaven</span>! the crisis--
            <br/>The danger is past,
            <br/>And the lingering illness
            <br/>Is <span class="prep open">over</span> at last--
            <br/>And the fever called "Living"
            <br/>Is <span class="verb closed">conquered</span> at last.
        </p>
      <p>
            Sadly, I know,
            <br/>I am <span class="verb closed">shorn</span> of my strength,
            <br/>And no muscle I move
            <br/>As I <span class="verb closed">lie</span> at full length--
            <br/>But no matter!--I feel
            <br/>I am better at length.
        </p>
      <p>
            And I rest so composedly,
            <br/>Now <span class="prep closed">in</span> my bed,
            <br/>That any beholder
            <br/>Might fancy me <span class="adj closed">dead</span>--
            <br/>Might start at beholding me
            <br/>Thinking me <span class="adj closed">dead</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            The moaning and groaning,
            <br/>The sighing and sobbing,
            <br/>Are quieted now,
            <br/>With that horrible throbbing
            <br/>At heart:--ah, that horrible,
            <br/>Horrible throbbing!
        </p>
      <p>
            The sickness--the nausea--
            <br/>The pitiless pain--
            <br/>Have <span class="verb open">ceased</span>, with the fever
            <br/>That maddened my brain--
            <br/>With the fever called "Living"
            <br/>That burned <span class="prep closed">in</span> my brain.
        </p>
      <p>
            And oh! of all <span class="noun closed">tortures</span>
            <br/>That <span class="noun closed">torture</span> the worst
            <br/>Has abated--the terrible
            <br/>
         <span class="noun closed">Torture</span> of thirst,
            <br/>For the naphthaline river
            <br/>Of Passion <span class="verb closed">accurst</span>:--
            <br/>I have drank of a water
            <br/>That <span class="verb open">quenches</span> all thirst:--
        </p>
      <p>
            Of a water that flows,
            <br/>With a lullaby sound,
            <br/>From a spring but a very few
            <br/>Feet <span class="prep closed">under</span> ground--
            <br/>From a cavern not very far
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">Down</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">under</span> ground.
        </p>
      <p>
            And ah! let it never
            <br/>Be foolishly said
            <br/>That my room it is gloomy
            <br/>And narrow my bed--
            <br/>For man never slept
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> a different bed;
            <br/>And, to sleep, you must slumber
            <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">In</span> just such a bed.
        </p>
      <p>
            My <span class="adj closed">tantalized</span> 
         <span class="noun open">spirit</span>
            <br/>Here blandly reposes,
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Forgetting</span>, or never
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Regretting</span> its roses--
            <br/>Its old agitations
            <br/>Of myrtles and roses:
        </p>
      <p>
            For now, while so quietly
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Lying</span>, it fancies
            <br/>A holier odor
            <br/>About it, of pansies--
            <br/>A rosemary odor,
            <br/>Commingled with pansies--
            <br/>With rue and the beautiful
            <br/>Puritan pansies.
        </p>
      <p>
            And so it <span class="verb closed">lies</span> happily,
            <br/>Bathing in many
            <br/>A dream of the truth
            <br/>And the beauty of Annie--
            <br/>
         <span class="verb closed">Drowned</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> a bath
            <br/>Of the tresses of Annie.
        </p>
      <p>
            She tenderly kissed me,
            <br/>She fondly caressed,
            <br/>And then I <span class="verb closed">fell</span> gently
            <br/>To sleep on her breast--
            <br/>
         <span class="adv closed">Deeply</span> to sleep
            <br/>From the <span class="noun open">heaven</span> of her breast.
        </p>
      <p>
            When the light was <span class="verb ">extinguished</span>,
            <br/>She <span class="verb closed">covered</span> me warm,
            <br/>And she prayed to the <span class="noun open">angels</span>
            <br/>To <span class="verb closed">keep</span> me from harm--
            <br/>To the queen of the <span class="noun open">angels</span>
            <br/>To <span class="verb closed">shield</span> me from harm.
        </p>
      <p>
            And I <span class="verb closed">lie</span> so composedly,
            <br/>Now <span class="prep closed">in</span> my bed
            <br/>(Knowing her love)
            <br/>That you fancy me <span class="adj closed">dead</span>--
            <br/>And I <span class="verb closed">rest</span> so contentedly,
            <br/>Now <span class="prep closed">in</span> my bed,
            <br/>(With her love at my breast)
            <br/>That you fancy me <span class="adj closed">dead</span>--
            <br/>That you shudder to look at me.
            <br/>Thinking me <span class="adj closed">dead</span>.
        </p>
      <p>
            But my heart it is brighter
            <br/>Than all of the many
            <br/>
         <span class="noun open">Stars</span> 
         <span class="prep closed">in</span> the sky,
            <br/>For it sparkles with Annie--
            <br/>It <span class="verb open">glows</span> with the light
            <br/>Of the love of my Annie--
            <br/>With the thought of the light
            <br/>Of the eyes of my Annie.
