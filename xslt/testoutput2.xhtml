      <h1>Fairyland</h1>
      <p>
        Dim vales—and shadowy floods—
        <br/>And cloudy-looking woods,
        <br/>Whose forms we can't discover
        <br/>For the tears that drip all over
        <br/>Huge moons there <span class="verb open">wax</span> and <span class="verb closed">wane</span>—
        <br/>Again—again—again—
        <br/>Every moment of the night—
        <br/>Forever changing places—
        <br/>And they put <span class="adv open">out</span> the star-light
        <br/>With the breath from their pale faces.
        <br/>About twelve by the moon-dial
        <br/>One more filmy than the rest
        <br/>(A kind which, upon trial,
        <br/>They have found to be the best)
        <br/>Comes <span class="adv closed">down</span>—still <span class="prep closed">down</span>—and <span class="verb closed">down</span>
        <br/>With its centre on the crown
        <br/>Of a mountain's eminence,
        <br/>While its wide <span class="noun closed">circumference</span>
        <br/>In easy drapery <span class="verb closed">falls</span>
        <br/>Over <span class="foreign ">hamlets</span>, over halls,
        <br/>Wherever they may be—
        <br/>O'er the strange woods—o'er the sea—
        <br/>Over spirits on the wing—
        <br/>Over every drowsy thing—
        <br/>And <span class="verb closed">buries</span> them up quite
        <br/>In a <span class="noun closed">labyrinth</span> of light—
        <br/>And then, how <span class="adj closed">deep</span>!—O, <span class="adj closed">deep</span>!
        <br/>Is the passion of their sleep.
        <br/>In the morning they <span class="verb open">arise</span>,
        <br/>And their moony <span class="noun closed">covering</span>
        <br/>Is <span class="verb open">soaring</span> in the <span class="noun open">skies</span>,
        <br/>With the tempests as they toss,
        <br/>Like—almost any thing—
        <br/>Or a yellow Albatross.
        <br/>They use that moon no more
        <br/>For the same end as before—
        <br/>
         <span class="foreign ">Videlicet</span> a tent—
        <br/>Which I think extravagant:
        <br/>Its atomies, however,
        <br/>
         <span class="prep closed">Into</span> a shower <span class="foreign ">dissever</span>,
        <br/>Of which those butterflies,
        <br/>Of Earth, who seek the <span class="noun open">skies</span>,
        <br/>And so come <span class="adv closed">down</span> again
        <br/>(Never-contented thing!)
        <br/>Have brought a specimen
        <br/>Upon their quivering wings.
