        <title>Hymn (translation from the Greek
        Hymn to Aristogeiton and Harmodius</title>
        <date>1827</date>

    <stanza>
        <lb/>Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal,
        <lb/>Like those champions devoted and brave,
        <lb/>When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
        <lb/>And to Athens deliverance gave.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam
        <lb/>In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
        <lb/>Where the mighty of old have their homeâ€”
        <lb/>Where Achilles and Diomed rest.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,
        <lb/>Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,
        <lb/>When he made at the tutelar shrine
        <lb/>A libation of Tyranny's blood.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!
        <lb/>Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!
        <lb/>Endless ages shall cherish your fame,
        <lb/>Embalmed in their echoing songs!
    </stanza>
