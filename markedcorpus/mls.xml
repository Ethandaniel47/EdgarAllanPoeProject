    <stanza>
        <l>Of all who hail thy presence as the morning;</l>
        <l>Of all to whom thine absence is the night,</l>
        <l>The blotting utterly from out high heaven</l>
        <l>The sacred sun; of all who, weeping, bless thee</l>
        <l>Hourly for hope, for life, ah! above all,</l>
        <l>For the resurrection of deep-buried faith</l>
        <l>In truth, in virtue, in humanity;</l>
        <l>Of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed</l>
        <l>Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen</l>
        <l>At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!"</l>
        <l>At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled</l>
        <l>In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes;</l>
        <l>Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude</l>
        <l>Nearest resembles worship, oh, remember</l>
        <l>The truest, the most fervently devoted,</l>
        <l>And think that these weak lines are written by him:</l>
        <l>By him, who, as he pens them, thrills to think</l>
        <l>His spirit is communing with an angel's.</l>
