        <title>The Lake</title>

    <stanza>
        <l>In spring of youth it was my lot</l>
        <l>To haunt of the wide world a spot</l>
        <l>The which I could not love the less—</l>
        <l>So lovely was the loneliness</l>
        <l>Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,</l>
        <l>And the tall pines that towered around.</l>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <l>But when the Night had thrown her pall</l>
        <l>Upon the spot, as upon all,</l>
        <l>And the mystic wind went by</l>
        <l>Murmuring in melody—</l>
        <l>Then—ah, then, I would awake</l>
        <l>To the terror of the lone lake.</l>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <l>Yet that terror was not fright,</l>
        <l>But a tremulous delight—</l>
        <l>A feeling not the jewelled mine</l>
        <l>Could teach or bribe me to define—</l>
        <l>Nor Love—although the Love were thine.</l>
    </stanza>
   <stanza>
       <l>Death was in that poisonous wave,</l>
       <l>And in its gulf a fitting grave</l>
       <l>For him who thence could solace bring</l>
       <l>To his lone imagining—</l>
       <l>Whose solitary soul could make</l>
       <l>An Eden of that dim lake.</l>
