        <title>The Lake</title>
        <date>1827</date>

    <stanza>
        <l>In spring of youth it was my lot</l>
        <l>To <verb value="closed">haunt</verb> of the wide world a spot</l>
        <l>The which I could not love the less—</l>
        <l>So lovely was the <adj value="closed">loneliness</adj></l>
        <l>Of a wild lake, with black rock <verb value="closed">bound</verb>,</l>
        <l>And the <adj value="open">tall</adj> pines that <verb value="open">towered</verb> <adv value="closed">around</adv>.</l>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <l>But when the Night had thrown her pall</l>
        <l>Upon the spot, as upon all,</l>
        <l>And the mystic wind went by</l>
        <l>Murmuring in melody—</l>
        <l>Then—ah, then, I would <verb value="open">awake</verb></l>
        <l>To the <noun value="closed">terror</noun> of the lone lake.</l>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <l>Yet that <noun value="closed">terror</noun> was not fright,</l>
        <l>But a tremulous delight—</l>
        <l>A feeling not the jewelled mine</l>
        <l>Could <verb value="open">teach</verb> or <verb value="closed">bribe</verb> me to define—</l>
        <l>Nor Love—although the Love were thine.</l>
    </stanza>
   <stanza>
       <l><noun value="open">Death</noun> was in that poisonous wave,</l>
       <l>And in its gulf a fitting <noun value="closed">grave</noun></l>
       <l>For him who thence could solace bring</l>
       <l>To his lone imagining—</l>
       <l>Whose <adj value="closed">solitary</adj> soul could make</l>
       <l>An <ref value="biblical">Eden</ref> of that dim lake.</l>
