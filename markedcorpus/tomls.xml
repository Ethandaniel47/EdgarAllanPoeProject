    <stanza>
        <lb/>Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
        <lb/>In the mad pride of intellectuality,
        <lb/>Maintained "the power of words"—denied that ever
        <lb/>A thought arose within the human brain
        <lb/>Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
        <lb/>And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
        <lb/>Two words—two foreign soft dissyllables—
        <lb/>Italian tones, made only to be murmured
        <lb/>By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
        <lb/>That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"—
        <lb/>Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
        <lb/>Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
        <lb/>Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
        <lb/>Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,
        <lb/>(Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,")
        <lb/>Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
        <lb/>The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
        <lb/>With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
        <lb/>I cannot write—I cannot speak or think—
        <lb/>Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
        <lb/>This standing motionless upon the golden
        <lb/>Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
        <lb/>Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
        <lb/>And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
        <lb/>Upon the left, and all the way along,
        <lb/>Amid empurpled vapors, far away
        <lb/>To where the prospect terminates—thee only!
    </stanza>
