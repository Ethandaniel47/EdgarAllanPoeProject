    <stanza>
        <lb/>A <adj value="closed">dark</adj> unfathomed tide
        <lb/>Of interminable prideâ€”
        <lb/>A mystery, and a dream,
        <lb/>Should my early life seem;
        <lb/>I say that dream was fraught
        <lb/>With a wild and waking thought
        <lb/>Of beings that have been,
        <lb/>Which my spirit hath not seen,
        <lb/>Had I let them pass me by,
        <lb/>With a dreaming eye!
        <lb/>Let none of earth inherit
        <lb/>That vision on my spirit;
        <lb/>Those thoughts I would control,
        <lb/>As a spell upon his soul:
        <lb/>For that bright hope at last
        <lb/>And that light time have past,
        <lb/>And my wordly <noun value="closed">rest</noun> hath gone
        <lb/>With a sigh as it passed on:
        <lb/>I care not though it perish
        <lb/>With a thought I then did cherish.
