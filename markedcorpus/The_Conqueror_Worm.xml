<poem><title>The Conqueror Worm</title>

<stanza>Lo! 'tis a gala <noun value="closed">night</noun> 
Within the <adj value="closed">lonesome</adj> latter years!
An <noun value="open">angel</noun> throng, bewinged, bedight 
In <noun value="closed">veils</noun>, and <verb value="closed">drowned</verb> in tears,
Sit in a theatre, to see 
A play of hopes and fears,
While the orchestra <verb value="open">breathes</verb> fitfully 
The music of the spheres.</stanza> 

<stanza>Mimes, in the form of God on high, 
Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither <verb value="open">fly</verb>—
Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of <adj value="open">vast</adj> formless things 
That shift the scenery to and fro,
Flapping <prep value="open">from</prep> <adv value="open">out</adv> their Condor wings 
Invisible Wo!</stanza> 

<stanza>That motley drama—oh, be sure 
It shall not be forgot!
With its Phantom chased for evermore, 
By a crowd that <verb value="closed">seize</verb> it not,
<prep value="open">Through</prep> a <noun value="closed">circle</noun> that ever returneth <prep value="closed">in</prep> 
To the self-same spot,
And much of Madness, and more of Sin, 
And Horror the soul of the plot.</stanza> 

<stanza>But see, <prep value="closed">amid</prep> the mimic rout 
A crawling shape <verb value="closed">intrude</verb>!
A blood-red thing that writhes <prep value="open">from</prep> <adv value="open">out</adv> 
The scenic <noun value="closed">solitude</noun>!
It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs 
The mimes become its food,
And the angels sob at vermin fangs 
<prep vlaue="closed">In</prep> human gore imbued.</stanza> 

<stanza>Out—out are the lights—out all! 
And, <prep value="closed">over</prep> each quivering form,
The <noun value="closed">curtain</noun>, a funeral <noun value="closed">pall</noun>, 
Comes <adv value="closed">down</adv> with the rush of a storm,
And the <noun value="open">angels</noun>, all pallid and wan, 
<verb value="open">Uprising</verb>, <verb value="open">unveiling</verb>, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, "Man," 
And its hero the Conqueror Worm.</stanza>
