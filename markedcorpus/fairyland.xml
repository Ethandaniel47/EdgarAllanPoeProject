    <stanza>
        <lb/>Dim vales—and shadowy floods—
        <lb/>And cloudy-looking woods,
        <lb/>Whose forms we can't discover
        <lb/>For the tears that drip all over
        <lb/>Huge moons there wax and wane—
        <lb/>Again—again—again—
        <lb/>Every moment of the night—
        <lb/>Forever changing places—
        <lb/>And they put out the star-light
        <lb/>With the breath from their pale faces.
        <lb/>About twelve by the moon-dial
        <lb/>One more filmy than the rest
        <lb/>(A kind which, upon trial,
        <lb/>They have found to be the best)
        <lb/>Comes down—still down—and down
        <lb/>With its centre on the crown
        <lb/>Of a mountain's eminence,
        <lb/>While its wide circumference
        <lb/>In easy drapery falls
        <lb/>Over hamlets, over halls,
        <lb/>Wherever they may be—
        <lb/>O'er the strange woods—o'er the sea—
        <lb/>Over spirits on the wing—
        <lb/>Over every drowsy thing—
        <lb/>And <verb value="closed">buries</verb> them up quite
        <lb/>In a labyrinth of light—
        <lb/>And then, how deep!—O, deep!
        <lb/>Is the passion of their sleep.
        <lb/>In the morning they arise,
        <lb/>And their moony covering
        <lb/>Is soaring in the skies,
        <lb/>With the tempests as they toss,
        <lb/>Like—almost any thing—
        <lb/>Or a yellow Albatross.
        <lb/>They use that moon no more
        <lb/>For the same end as before—
        <lb/>Videlicet a tent—
        <lb/>Which I think extravagant:
        <lb/>Its atomies, however,
        <lb/>Into a shower dissever,
        <lb/>Of which those butterflies,
        <lb/>Of Earth, who seek the skies,
        <lb/>And so come down again
        <lb/>(Never-contented thing!)
        <lb/>Have brought a specimen
        <lb/>Upon their quivering wings.
