    <stanza>
        <lb/>The happiest day—the happiest hour
        <lb/>My seared and blighted heart hath known,
        <lb/>The highest hope of pride and power,
        <lb/>I feel hath flown.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween
        <lb/>But they have vanished long, alas!
        <lb/>The visions of my youth have been—
        <lb/>But let them pass.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>And pride, what have I now with thee?
        <lb/>Another brow may ev'n inherit
        <lb/>The venom thou hast poured on me—
        <lb/>Be still my spirit!
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>The happiest day—the happiest hour
        <lb/>Mine eyes shall see—have ever seen
        <lb/>The brightest glance of pride and power
        <lb/>I feel have been:
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>But were that hope of pride and power
        <lb/>Now offered with the pain
        <lb/>Ev'n then I felt—that brightest hour
        <lb/>I would not live again:
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>For on its wing was dark alloy
        <lb/>And as it fluttered—fell
        <lb/>An essence—powerful to destroy
        <lb/>A soul that knew it well.
    </stanza>
