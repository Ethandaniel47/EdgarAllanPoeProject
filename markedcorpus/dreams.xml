    <stanza>
        <lb/>Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
        <lb/>My spirit not awakening, till the beam
        <lb/>Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.
        <lb/>Yes! though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
        <lb/>'Twere better than the cold reality
        <lb/>Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
        <lb/>And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
        <lb/>A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
        <lb/>But should it be—that dream eternally
        <lb/>Continuing—as dreams have been to me
        <lb/>In my young boyhood—should it thus be given,
        <lb/>'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.
        <lb/>For I have revelled when the sun was bright
        <lb/>I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light
        <lb/>And loveliness,—have left my very heart
        <lb/>Inclines of my imaginary apart1
        <lb/>From mine own home, with beings that have been
        <lb/>Of mine own thought—what more could I have seen?
        <lb/>'Twas once—and only once—and the wild hour
        <lb/>From my remembrance shall not pass—some power
        <lb/>Or spell had bound me—'twas the chilly wind
        <lb/>Came o'er me in the night, and left behind
        <lb/>Its image on my spirit—or the moon
        <lb/>Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
        <lb/>Too coldly—or the stars—howe'er it was
        <lb/>That dream was that that night-wind—let it pass.
        <lb/>I have been happy, though in a dream.
        <lb/>I have been happy—and I love the theme:
        <lb/>Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life
        <lb/>As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
        <lb/>Of semblance with reality which brings
        <lb/>To the delirious eye, more lovely things
        <lb/>Of Paradise and Love—and all my own!—
        <lb/>Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.
