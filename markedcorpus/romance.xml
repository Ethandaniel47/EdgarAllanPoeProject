    <title>ROMANCE</title>
    
    <line>Romance, who loves to nod and sing</line>
    <line>With drowsy head and <verb value="closed">folded</verb> wing</line>
    <line>Among the green leaves as they shake</line>
    <line>Far <adv value="closed">down</adv> <prep value="closed">within</prep> some shadowy lake,</line>
    <line>To me a painted <foreign lang="fr">paroquet</foreign></line>
    <line>Hath been—a most familiar bird—</line>
    <line>Taught me my alphabet to say,</line>
    <line>To lisp my very earliest word</line>
    <line>While in the wild-wood I did <verb value="closed">lie</verb>,</line>
    <line>A child—with a most knowing eye.</line>
    
    <line>Of late, eternal <foreign lang="sp">condor</foreign> years</line>
    <line>So shake the very <noun value="noun">heaven</noun> on high</line>
    <line>With <foreign lang="latin">tumult</foreign> as they thunder by,</line>
    <line>I have no time for idle cares</line>
    <line>Through gazing on the unquiet sky;</line>
    <line>And when an hour with calmer wings</line>
    <line>Its <adv value="closed">down</adv> upon my spirit <verb value="closed">flings</verb>,</line>
    <line>That little time with lyre and rhyme</line>
    <line>To while away—<adj value="closed">forbidden</adj> things—</line>
    <line>My heart would feel to be a crime</line>
    <line>Unless it trembled with the strings.</line>
