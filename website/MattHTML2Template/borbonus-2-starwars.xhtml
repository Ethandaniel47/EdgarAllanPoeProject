                 <p>One of my favorite series of films is the Star Wars Prequels. I think they are highly underraterd (though I will concede that the writing in Attack of the Clones was terrible). 
                     For those that don't know the Star Wars Prequels is a trilogy of films that take place before the Original Trilogy(Star Wars Episodes IV through VI) and consist of the following titles :</p>
                 <ol class="movielist">
                     <li>The Phantom Menace</li>
                     <li>Attack of the Clones</li>
                     <li>Revenge of the Sith</li>
                 </ol>

                     <img class="movieart" src="phantommenace.jpg" alt="PhantomMenace"/>
                     <img class="movieart" src="attackclones.jpg" alt="AttackOftheClones"/>
                     <img class="movieart" src="revengeofsith.jpg" alt="RevengeoftheSith"/>

                 <p>While these are the primary focus, by definition two other recently made films can constitute as prequels since they take place before the events of Star Wars 4. These would be <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i> and <i>Rogue One</i>. 
                     Also, <i>Star Wars The Clone Wars</i> counts and covers the events directly between Episode II and III (Both the animated series and the 2003 cartoon are pretty decent. 2003 cartoon is not canon though).
                 The prequels were released after the original trilogy (which I think was the best move. It might not have been as popular if Episode I was released first.) and as such focus more on how the status quo at the start of Episode 4 came to be.
                 The main focus of the plot is Anakin Skywalker and his relationship with Padme Amidala, though the other ongoing events are given similar importance. One of the weakest points of the prequels was this relationship,
                 as I feel that it wasn't done well. This coupled with it being central to the plot is one of the main reasons why the prequels have a bad reputation. Another downside is the politics. I don't mind them, I think fits the portrayal 
                 of a failing government rather well. However, the politics do take up quite a bit of screen time, so I understand why that wasn't well received.</p>
                 <p>As for what I enjoy about the Prequels, well there are a few reasons. First, the CGI is simply amazing. It has aged pretty well to this day and infact I sometimes forget what's CGI and not. It was also blended really well with the
                 actors, so it doesn't feel intrusive at all. The characters themselves are actually interesting, and The Clone Wars series expands upon their strengths and weaknesses in personality. Finally, one other reason I like he preqquels is
                 the world building. They created a brand new world within the existing story, while still maintaining that atmosphere that makes Star Wars unique.</p>

             <h2>Prequel Memes</h2>
             <div class="mainbody">    
                 <p>One thing that has enhanced my appreciation of the star wars prequels, are the memes that have been made out of them. My favorite site to browse for these specific memes is none other than <a class="plink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/" target="_blank">r/PrequelMemes</a>.
                 A lot of reposts float around in this subreddit, but quality original content manages to come through often enough. For the end of this webpage, I will share some memes I enjoy.</p>
