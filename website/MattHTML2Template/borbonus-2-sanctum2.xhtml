                <h2>Backstory</h2>
                <p>This was one of those unpolished gems that I came across one day. I didn't even know about the Sanctum series, until one day one of my friends pointed out that Humble Bundle was offering this game for free. It didn't seem that intersting at first, but when I gave it another shot some time later, it became one of my favorite games.</p>
                <p><i>Sanctum 2</i> is a hybrid of the Tower Defense and FPS genres, developed by <a class="textlink" href="https://www.coffeestainstudios.com/">Coffee Stain Studios</a>. Like a tower defense, you can build mazes to re-route your enemy, and construct towers to fire upon the enemy. However, unlike a normal tower defense, you are also on the battlefield, fighting alongside your towers. This is required as your towers in the early stages of each map cannot hold off the enemy by themselves. Initially, the concept of having to babysit towers was very off putting for me due to my experiences with other tower defence games like Dungeon Defenders, but once I got over it, it made for quite a thrilling challenge.</p>
                <p>For a quick rundown of the backstory (by the way, there was no story to Sanctum 1, just gameplay). Humans have landed on a planet called Loek III and established a colony. After some time, the native wildlife (called Lumes) get angry and start attacking the colony, in particular the colony's source of power, the Cores. You the player follow the efforts of a Core Guardian squad in the upcoming conflict of humans versus lumes. What I find unique about the story is that most of it is told via comic book panels that are shown on the loading screen between maps (you have to manually click through them, so no worries about missing something if running the game on a high end PC).</p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>For gameplay, this game certainly delivers a satisfying experience. At the start of every map, you have to choose a loadout. Loadouts consist of picking a character, choosing two weapons, picking four towers, and three perks. Once you have locked in your loadout, it cannot change until the end of the map or you restart the map.</p>
                <p>One thing where this game excels in is variety of selection (though some selections are weaker than others). There are 5 characters to pick from, 4 from the base game, 1 as DLC. Each character has innate perks that are different for each. These perks definitely change the way they play and what builds you can make with them. These 5 can be found below (credit to whoever from the Dev team drew these):</p>

                        <img class="charimg" src="Haigen_Hawkins.png" alt="Heigen"/>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="character">
                        <p class="charname">TSYGAN</p>
                        <img class="charimg" src="tsygan2.png" alt="TSYGAN"/>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Each character is useful in their own right. If you must know, TSYGAN is my favorite, though she's incredibly difficult to use properly, sometimes even for me. You do not start with every weapon and perk, you have to unlock them by leveling up. Also, you cannot switch your character's primary weapon until level 40 (out of 50). Leveling up is simple, you get xp from finishing maps, regardless of win or loss.</p>
                <p>As for the actual gameplay, it is deceivingly simple, but actually has quite a bit of depth to it. There's a couple map exceptions to this, but for the most part, the player has complete control of setting up mazes for the enemies to walk through to slow down their process. In fact, the tower bases that make the mazes can only be destroyed by two different bosses, so you don't have to worry about that happening most of the time. Each map has different Lume compositions in each wave, so playing on a map you haven't played before is a new learning experience in more ways than one. Learning new maze/tower layouts is essential to succeeding, especially when playing on the hardest difficulty.</p>
                <p>At this point, I feel that I must talk about perks. The game developers were really creative here where instead of doing boring perks like "+50% damage", you instead get bonuses by interacting with the world. For example, the Fast Hands perk makes it that you gain +35% damage for 5 seconds whenever you reload a weapon, which means that emptying clips quickly and rotating weapons during reloading makes this bonus damage constant(did I forget to mention that when reloading a weapon, switching weapons does not interrupt the reload? This is an intentional feature). However, not reloading quickly, either due to using a slow firing weapon, or lack of interaction with lumes, will lead to the player losing their bonus damage more often than necessary to be efficient with it. Another perk, "Engineer", buffs tower damage... if you're within a small radius around the tower. This limits your mobility if you want to maximize this perk. As you have guessed, perks can greatly changeup your playstyle, and since there are a lot of perks to pick from, experimentation of perk synergy is encouraged.</p>
                <p>The difficulty in this game feels appropriate on the normal difficulty. The starter turrets fulfill their role well on this difficulty, allowing turret composition experimentation, and you can experiment with perk combinations more. To increase the difficulty past normal, you have to enable these modifiers called feats of strength. Four feats buff lumes, one debuffs players with one life per wave and decreased resale value on towers. Having all 5 enabled at the same time can be very brutal, especially on solo. Be warned though, once you get used to 5 feats of strength (if you bother with them anyway), it's really hard to go back to playing the game without them turned on since it will feel so much easier than before.</p>

                <h2>Marketing and DLC</h2>
                <p>Just a quick sidenote, I think this game is a model of what DLC should be like. Each DLC is very cheap ($5 each according to Steam, with the exception of two, one adds skins, the other is the soundtrack). Each of these $5 DLC adds four maps, a couple weapons and towers, and a few perks. Also, new enemy types that the player can encounter, and a completely new boss type (thugh it only shows up in one map pack). They all feel like mini-expansions, instead of content that was simply cut from the release of the game. Also, since it adds more maps, it continues the story right from where the base game left off. This is a bonus because the original ending was kind of a cliffhanger. Also, I believe the quality of the story in the DLC continuation is simply better. The only downside is the soundtrack dlc on steam. I don't have it, but frrom what I hear, it only has soundtracks from the base game, nothing from the DLC maps, which is disappointing. I reccommend trying the base game first for a little bit, and if you end up liking it, I highly reccommend getting the DLC. </p>
                <p>As for marketing, well I just wanted to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvPCU_B_s-k">this little ad</a> they made for the first DLC, <i>Road to Elysion</i>. This is either one of the dumbest ads you have ever watched, or one of the greatest. Either way, it's a great throwback to older commercial styles, and it shows that the devs at least have a sense of humor.</p>

                <h2>Screenshots</h2>
                <p>I figured that I would include some screenshots from the game as well. I don't have much for right now since I am arriving at this section in the middle of the night.</p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="S2screenshot2.jpg" alt="Screenshot1"/>
                <p>This is is just showcasing a basic maze that uses the terrain to re-route lumes.</p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="S2screenshot1.jpg" alt="Screenshot2"/>
                <p>This one I'm showing for laughs. In the DLC maps, there is a lume type that can upgrade other lumes like how the players upgrade towers. After some shenanigans, this happened. I apologize for unintentionally obscuring the enemy itself in this photo.</p>
