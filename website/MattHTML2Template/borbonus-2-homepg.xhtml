                <p>Hello There! For my assignment, I decided to do webpages about the different series that interested me. Mostly movies and videogames since its easy to make pages out of those. 
                    You already knew about the Star Wars from assignment 1, but I figured I'd talk about a couple other things as well. I don't know how much I'll be able to complete before the project deadline, but I'll do my best. Also, titles and names are not my strong suite which is why the title of this page is just Homepage.</p>
